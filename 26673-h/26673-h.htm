<h2>I</h2>
<h3>The End of the Honeymoon</h3>
</div>

<p>It was certainly a queer house. Even
through the blinding storm they could
distinguish its eccentric outlines as they alighted
from the stage. Dorothy laughed happily,
heedless of the fact that her husband&#8217;s umbrella
was dripping down her neck. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
dear old place,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;I love it already!&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant a flash of lightning turned the
peculiar windows into sheets of flame, then
all was dark again. Harlan&#8217;s answer was
drowned by a crash of thunder and the turning
of the heavy wheels on the gravelled road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop,&#8221; shouted the driver; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
come up to-morrer for the money. Good luck
to you&mdash;an&#8217; the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he mean?&#8221; asked Dorothy,
shaking out her wet skirts, when they were
safely inside the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;s got a Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can search me,&#8221; answered Harlan,
concisely, fumbling for a match. &#8220;I suppose
we&#8217;ve got it. Anyhow, we&#8217;ll have a look at
this sepulchral mansion presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>His deep voice echoed and re-echoed
through the empty rooms, and Dorothy
laughed; a little hysterically this time. Match
after match sputtered and failed. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
have got much wetter if I&#8217;d been in swimming,&#8221;
he grumbled. &#8220;Here goes the last
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the uncertain light they found a candle
and Harlan drew a long breath of relief. &#8220;It
would have been pleasant, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;We could have sat on the stairs
until morning, or broken our admirable necks
in falling over strange furniture. The next
thing is a fire. Wonder where my distinguished
relative kept his wood?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lighting another candle, he went off on a
tour of investigation, leaving Dorothy alone.</p>
<p>She could not repress a shiver as she glanced
around the gloomy room. The bare loneliness
of the place was accentuated by the depressing
furniture, which belonged to the black
walnut and haircloth period. On the marble-topped
table, in the exact centre of the room,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
was a red plush album, flanked on one side
by a hideous china vase, and on the other by
a basket of wax flowers under a glass shade.</p>
<p>Her home-coming! How often she had
dreamed of it, never for a moment guessing
that it might be like this! She had fancied a
little house in a suburb, or a cosy apartment
in the city, and a lump came into her throat
as her air castle dissolved into utter ruin. She
was one of those rare, unhappy women
whose natures are so finely attuned to beauty
that ugliness hurts like physical pain.</p>
<p>She sat down on one of the slippery haircloth
chairs, facing the mantel where the
single candle threw its tiny light afar. Little
by little the room crept into shadowy relief&mdash;the
melodeon in the corner, the what-not,
with its burden of incongruous ornaments, and
even the easel bearing the crayon portrait of
the former mistress of the house, becoming
faintly visible.</p>
<p>Presently, from above the mantel, appeared
eyes. Dorothy felt them first, then looked
up affrighted. From the darkness they
gleamed upon her in a way that made her
heart stand still. Human undoubtedly, but
not in the least friendly, they were the eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
of one who bitterly resented the presence of
an intruder. The light flickered, then flamed
up once more and brought into view the features
that belonged with the eyes.</p>
<p>Dorothy would have screamed, had it not
been for the lump in her throat. A step came
nearer and nearer, from some distant part of
the house, accompanied by a cheery, familiar
whistle. Still the stern, malicious face held
her spellbound, and even when Harlan came
in with his load of wood, she could not turn
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we&#8217;ll start a fire and
hang ourselves up to dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dorothy, her lips
scarcely moving.</p>
<p>His eyes followed hers. &#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
portrait,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Why, Dorothy
Carr! I believe you&#8217;re scared!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was scared,&#8221; she admitted, reluctantly,
after a brief silence, smiling a little at her own
foolishness. &#8220;It&#8217;s so dark and gloomy in here,
and you were gone so long&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off into an indistinct
murmur, but she still shuddered in spite of
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny old place,&#8221; commented Harlan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
kneeling on the hearth and laying kindlings,
log-cabin fashion, in the fireplace. &#8220;If an
architect planned it, he must have gone crazy
the week before he did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or at the time. Don&#8217;t, dear&mdash;wait a
minute. Let&#8217;s light our first fire together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as she slipped to her knees beside
him, and his hand held hers while the
blazing splinter set the pine kindling aflame.
Quickly the whole room was aglow with
light and warmth, in cheerful contrast to the
stormy tumult outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody said once,&#8221; observed Harlan,
as they drew their chairs close to the hearth,
&#8220;that four feet on a fender are sufficient for
happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends altogether on the feet,&#8221; rejoined
Dorothy, quickly. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want Uncle
Ebeneezer sitting here beside me&mdash;no disrespect
intended to your relation, as such.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old duck,&#8221; said Harlan, kindly.
&#8220;Life was never very good to him, and Death
took away the only thing he ever loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Rebecca,&#8221; he continued, feeling her
unspoken question. &#8220;She died suddenly,
when they had been married only three or
four weeks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Like us,&#8221; whispered Dorothy, for the first
time conscious of a tenderness toward the departed
Mr. Judson, of Judson Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was four weeks ago to-day, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; he mused, instinctively seeking her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d forgotten,&#8221; she smiled
back at him. &#8220;I feel like an old married
woman, already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look it,&#8221; he returned, gently.
Few would have called her beautiful, but love
brings beauty with it, and Harlan saw an exquisite
loveliness in the deep, dark eyes, the
brown hair that rippled and shone in the firelight,
the smooth, creamy skin, and the sensitive
mouth that betrayed every passing mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;None the less, I am,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
grown so used to seeing &#8216;Mrs. James Harlan
Carr&#8217; on my visiting cards that I&#8217;ve forgotten
there ever was such a person as &#8216;Miss Dorothy
Locke,&#8217; who used to get letters, and go calling
when she wasn&#8217;t too busy, and have things
sent to her when she had the money to buy
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope&mdash;&#8221; Harlan stumbled awkwardly
over the words&mdash;&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll never be
sorry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been yet,&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s four whole weeks. Come, let&#8217;s go on an
exploring expedition. I&#8217;m dry both inside
and out, and most terribly hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each took a candle and Harlan led the way,
in and out of unexpected doors, queer, winding
passages, and lonely, untenanted rooms.
Originally, the house had been simple enough
in structure, but wing after wing had been
added until the first design, if it could be dignified
by that name, had been wholly obscured.
From each room branched a series
of apartments&mdash;a sitting-room, surrounded by
bedrooms, each of which contained two or
sometimes three beds. A combined kitchen
and dining-room was in every separate wing,
with an outside door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; cried Dorothy, &#8220;if we&#8217;ve
come to an orphan asylum!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven knows what we&#8217;ve come to,&#8221;
muttered Harlan. &#8220;You know I never was
here before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Uncle Ebeneezer have a large family?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Aunt Rebecca, who died very soon,
as I told you. Mother was his only sister,
and I her only child, so it wasn&#8217;t on our
side.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; observed Dorothy, &#8220;Aunt Rebecca
had relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One, two, three, four, five,&#8221; counted Harlan.
&#8220;There are five sets of apartments on this side,
and three on the other. Let&#8217;s go upstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the low front door a series of low
windows extended across the house on each
side, abundantly lighting the two front rooms,
which were separated by the wide hall. A
high, narrow window in the lower hall, seemingly
with no purpose whatever, began far
above the low door and ended abruptly at the
ceiling. In the upper hall, a similar window
began at the floor and extended upward no
higher than Harlan&#8217;s knees. As Dorothy said,
&#8220;one would have to lie down to look out of
it,&#8221; but it lighted the hall, which, after all,
was the main thing.</p>
<p>In each of the two front rooms, upstairs,
was a single round window, too high for one
to look out of without standing on a chair,
though in both rooms there was plenty of side
light. One wing on each side of the house
had been carried up to the second story, and
the arrangement of rooms was the same as
below, outside stairways leading from the
kitchens to the ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw so many beds in my life,&#8221;
cried Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to be a perfect Bedlam,&#8221; rejoined
Harlan, making a poor attempt at a joke and
laughing mirthlessly. In his heart he began
to doubt the wisdom of marrying on six hundred
dollars, an unexplored heirloom in Judson
Centre, and an overweening desire to write
books.</p>
<p>For the first time, his temerity appeared to
him in its proper colours. He had been a
space writer and Dorothy the private secretary
of a Personage, when they met, in the
dreary basement dining-room of a New York
boarding-house, and speedily fell in love.
Shortly afterward, when Harlan received a letter
which contained a key, and announced
that Mr. Judson&#8217;s house, fully furnished, had
been bequeathed to his nephew, they had
light-heartedly embarked upon matrimony
with no fears for the future.</p>
<p>Two hundred dollars had been spent upon
a very modest honeymoon, and the three
hundred and ninety-seven dollars and twenty-three
cents remaining, as Harlan had accurately
calculated, seemed pitifully small.
Perplexity, doubt, and foreboding were plainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
written on his face, when Dorothy turned to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it perfectly lovely,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;for
us to have this nice, quiet place all to ourselves,
where you can write your book?&#8221;</p>
<p>Woman-like, she had instantly touched the
right chord, and the clouds vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he cried, eagerly. &#8220;Oh, Dorothy,
do you think I can really write it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Write it,&#8221; she repeated; &#8220;why, you dear,
funny goose, you can write a better book than
anybody has ever written yet, and I know you
can! By next week we&#8217;ll be settled here and
you can get down to work. I&#8217;ll help you,
too,&#8221; she added, generously. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll buy
me a typewriter, I can copy the whole book
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll buy you a typewriter.
We&#8217;ll send for it to-morrow. How much
does a nice one cost?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kind I like,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;costs a
hundred dollars without the stand. I don&#8217;t
need the stand&mdash;we can find a table somewhere
that will do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and ninety-seven dollars
and twenty-three cents,&#8221; breathed Harlan,
unconsciously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, only a hundred dollars,&#8221; corrected
Dorothy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to have it silver
mounted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d buy you a gold one if you wanted it,&#8221;
stammered Harlan, in some confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; she returned, serenely. &#8220;Wait
till the book is done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visions of fame and fortune appeared before
his troubled eyes and set his soul alight with
high ambition. The candle in his hand burned
unsteadily and dripped tallow, unheeded.
&#8220;Come,&#8221; said Dorothy, gently, &#8220;let&#8217;s go
downstairs again.&#8221;</p>
<p>An open door revealed a tortuous stairway
at the back of the house, descending mysteriously
into cavernous gloom. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go down
here,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I love curly stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are kinky enough to please even
your refined fancy,&#8221; laughed Harlan. &#8220;It reminds
me of travelling in the West, where you
look out of the window and see your engine
on the track beside you, going the other way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be the kitchen,&#8221; said Dorothy,
when the stairs finally ceased. &#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer
appears to have had a pronounced fancy
for kitchens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another wing,&#8221; added Harlan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
opening the back door. &#8220;Sitting-room, bedroom,
and&mdash;my soul and body! It&#8217;s another
kitchen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any more beds?&#8221; queried Dorothy, peering
into the darkness. &#8220;We can&#8217;t keep house
unless we can find more beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one more. I guess we&#8217;ve come
down to bed rock at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, the cradle,&#8221; she observed,
pulling a little old-fashioned trundle bed out
into the light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a joke!&#8221; cried Harlan. &#8220;That&#8217;s
worth three dollars in the office of any funny
paper in New York!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell it,&#8221; commanded Dorothy, inspired by
the prospect of wealth, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll give you fifty
cents for your commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside, the storm still raged and the old
house shook and creaked in the blast. The
rain swirled furiously against the windows,
and a swift rush of hailstones beat a fierce
tattoo on the roof. Built on the summit of a
hill and with only a few trees near it, the
Judson mansion was but poorly protected
from the elements.</p>
<p>None the less, there was a sense of warmth
and comfort inside. &#8220;Let&#8217;s build a fire in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
kitchen,&#8221; suggested Dorothy, &#8220;and then we&#8217;ll
try to find something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which kitchen?&#8221; asked Harlan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any old kitchen. The one the back stairs
end in, I guess. It seems to be the principal
one of the set.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan brought more wood and Dorothy
watched him build the fire with a sense that
a god-like being was here put to base uses.
Hampered in his log-cabin design by the limitations
of the fire box, he handled the kindlings
awkwardly, got a splinter into his thumb, said
something under his breath which was not
meant for his wife to hear, and powdered his
linen with soot from the stove pipe. At
length, however, a respectable fire was started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what shall I do next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind all the clocks. I can&#8217;t endure a
dead clock. While you&#8217;re doing it, I&#8217;ll get
out the remnants of our lunch and see what
there is in the pantry that is still edible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the lunch basket which the erratic ramifications
of the road leading to Judson Centre
had obliged them to carry, there was still, fortunately,
a supply of sandwiches and fruit. A
hasty search through the nearest pantry revealed
jelly, marmalade, and pickles, a box of musty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
crackers and a canister of tea. When Harlan
came back, Dorothy had the kitchen table set
for two, with a lighted candle dispensing
odorous good cheer from the centre of it, and
the tea kettle singing merrily over the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like home, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he asked,
pleasantly imbued with the realisation of the
home-making quality in Dorothy. Certain
rare women with this gift take their atmosphere
with them wherever they go.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go into
the village and buy more things to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruling passion,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;what&#8217;s
that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Clear and high above the sound of the
storm came an imperious &#8220;Me-ow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cat,&#8221; said Harlan. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
suppose the poor thing is shut up anywhere,
do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it had been, we&#8217;d have found it.
We&#8217;ve opened every door in the house, I&#8217;m
sure. It must be outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me-ow! Me-ow! Me-ow!&#8221; The voice
was not pleading; it was rather a command, a
challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty, kitty, kitty,&#8221; she called. &#8220;Where
are you, kitty?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>Harlan opened the outside door, and in
rushed a huge black cat, with the air of one
returning home after a long absence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor kitty,&#8221; said Dorothy, kindly, stooping
to stroke the sable visitor, who instinctively
dodged the caress, and then scratched
her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ugly brute!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
touch him, Harlan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the meal the cat sat at a respectful
distance, with his greenish yellow
eyes fixed unwaveringly upon them. He was
entirely black, save for a white patch under
his chin, which, in the half-light, carried with
it an uncanny suggestion of a shirt front.
Dorothy at length became restless under the
calm scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Put him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you liked cats,&#8221; remarked Harlan,
reaching for another sandwich.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, but I don&#8217;t like this one. Please put
him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, in all this storm? He&#8217;ll get wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t wet when he came in,&#8221; objected
Dorothy. &#8220;He must have some warm, dry
place of his own outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, kitty,&#8221; said Harlan, pleasantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty&#8221; merely blinked, and Harlan rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, kitty.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the characteristic independence of
cats, the visitor yawned. The conversation
evidently bored him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, kitty,&#8221; said Harlan, more firmly,
with a low swoop of his arm. The cat
arched his back, erected an enlarged tail, and
hissed threateningly. In a dignified but effective
manner, he eluded all attempts to capture
him, even avoiding Dorothy and her broom.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something more or less imperial
about him,&#8221; she remarked, wiping her flushed
cheeks, when they had finally decided not to
put the cat out. &#8220;As long as he&#8217;s adopted
us, we&#8217;ll have to keep him. What shall we
name him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claudius Tiberius,&#8221; answered Harlan. &#8220;It
suits him down to the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His first name is certainly appropriate,&#8221;
laughed Dorothy, with a rueful glance at her
scratched hand. Making the best of a bad
bargain, she spread an old grey shawl, nicely
folded, on the floor by the stove, and requested
Claudius Tiberius to recline upon it,
but he persistently ignored the invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is jolly enough,&#8221; said Harlan. &#8220;A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
cosy little supper in our own house, with a
gale blowing outside, the tea kettle singing
over the fire, and a cat purring on the hearth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard Claudius purr?&#8221; asked
Dorothy, idly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, I haven&#8217;t. Perhaps
something is wrong with his purrer.
We&#8217;ll fix him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a remote part of the house came
twelve faint, silvery tones. The kitchen clock
struck next, with short, quick strokes, followed
immediately by a casual record of
the hour from the clock on the mantel beneath
Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s portrait. Then the
grandfather&#8217;s clock in the hall boomed out
twelve, solemn funereal chimes. Afterward,
the silence seemed acute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The end of the honeymoon,&#8221; said Dorothy,
a little sadly, with a quick, inquiring look
at her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;The end of the honeymoon!&#8221; repeated
Harlan, gathering her into his arms. &#8220;To-morrow,
life begins!&#8221;</p>
<p>Several hours later, Dorothy awoke from a
dreamless sleep to wonder whether life was
any different from a honeymoon, and if so,
how and why.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>The Day Afterward</h3>
</div>

<p>By the pitiless light of early morning, the
house was even uglier than at night.
With an irreverence essentially modern, Dorothy
decided, while she was dressing, to have
all the furniture taken out into the back yard,
where she could look it over at her leisure.
She would make a bonfire of most of it, or,
better yet, have it cut into wood for the fireplace.
Thus Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s cumbrous
bequest might be quickly transformed into
comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; thought Dorothy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take down
that hideous portrait over the mantel before
I&#8217;m a day older.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when she broached the subject to Harlan,
she found him unresponsive and somewhat
disinclined to interfere with the existing
order of things. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be here only for the
Summer,&#8221; he said, &#8220;so what&#8217;s the use of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
monkeying with the furniture and burning up
fifty or sixty beds? There&#8217;s plenty of wood
in the cellar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the furniture,&#8221; she pouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Harlan, with patronising
kindness, &#8220;as you grow older, you&#8217;ll find lots
of things on the planet which you don&#8217;t like.
Moreover, it&#8217;ll be quite out of your power to
cremate &#8217;em, and it&#8217;s just as well to begin
adjusting yourself now.&#8221;</p>
<p>This bit of philosophy irritated Mrs. Carr
unbearably. &#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; she demanded,
with rising temper, &#8220;that you won&#8217;t
do as I ask you to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; inquired Harlan,
wickedly, in exact imitation of her manner,
&#8220;that you won&#8217;t do as I ask you to? Four
weeks ago yesterday, if I remember rightly,
you promised to obey me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t remind me of what I&#8217;m ashamed
of!&#8221; flashed Dorothy. &#8220;If I&#8217;d known what
a brute you were, I&#8217;d never have married
you! You may be sure of that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudius Tiberius insinuated himself between
Harlan&#8217;s feet and rubbed against his
trousers, leaving a thin film of black fur in his
wake. Being fastidious about his personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
appearance, Harlan kicked Claudius Tiberius
vigorously, grabbed his hat and went out,
slamming the door, and whistling with an
exaggerated cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brute!&#8221; The word rankled deeply as he
went downhill with his hands in his pockets,
whistling determinedly. So Dorothy was
sorry she had married him! After all he&#8217;d
done for her, too. Giving up a good position
in New York, taking her half-way around the
world on a honeymoon, and bringing her to a
magnificent country residence in a fashionable
locality for the Summer!</p>
<p>Safely screened by the hill, he turned back
to look at the &#8220;magnificent country residence,&#8221;
then swore softly under his breath, as,
for the first time, he took in the full meaning
of the eccentric architecture.</p>
<p>Perched high upon the hill, with intervening
shrubbery carefully cut down, the Judson
mansion was not one to inspire confidence in
its possessor. Outwardly, it was grey and
weather-worn, with the shingles dropping off
in places. At the sides, the rambling wings
and outside stairways, branching off into
space, conveyed the impression that the house
had been recently subjected to a powerful influence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
of the centrifugal sort. But worst of
all was the front elevation, with its two round
windows, its narrow, long window in the
centre, and the low windows on either side
of the front door&mdash;the grinning, distorted
semblance of a human face.</p>
<p>The bare, uncurtained windows loomed up
boldly in the searching sunlight, which spared
nothing. The blue smoke rising from the
kitchen chimney appeared strangely like a
plume streaming out from the rear. Harlan
noted, too, that the railing of the narrow
porch extended almost entirely across the
front of the house, and remembered, dimly,
that they had found the steps at one side of
the porch the night before. Not a single unpleasant
detail was in any way hidden, and
he clutched instinctively at a tree as he
realised that the supports of the railing
were cunningly arranged to look like huge
teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; he said to himself &#8220;that the
stage driver called it the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern!
That&#8217;s exactly what it is! Why didn&#8217;t he
paint it yellow and be done with it? The
old devil!&#8221; The last disrespectful allusion,
of course, being meant for Uncle Ebeneezer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Dorothy,&#8221; he thought again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
burn the whole thing, and she shall put every
blamed crib into the purifying flames. It&#8217;s
mine, and I can do what I please with it.
We&#8217;ll go away to-morrow, we&#8217;ll go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Where could they go, with less than four
hundred dollars? Especially when one hundred
of it was promised for a typewriter?
Harlan had parted with his managing editor
on terms of great dignity, announcing that
he had forsworn journalism and would hereafter
devote himself to literature. The editor
had remarked, somewhat cynically, that it was
a better day for journalism than for literature,
the fine, inner meaning of the retort not having
been fully evident to Harlan until he was
some three squares away from the office.</p>
<p>Much chastened in spirit, and fully ready to
accept his wife&#8217;s estimate of him, he went on
downhill into Judson Centre.</p>
<p>It was the usual small town, the post-office,
grocery, meat market, and general loafing-place
being combined under one roof. Near by was
the blacksmith shop, and across from it was the
inevitable saloon. Far up in the hills was the
Judson Centre Sanitarium, a worthy institution
of some years standing, where every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
human ailment from tuberculosis to fits was
more or less successfully treated.</p>
<p>Upon the inmates of the sanitarium the inhabitants
of Judson Centre lived, both materially
and mentally. Few of them had ever
been nearer to it than the back door, but tales
of dark doings were widely prevalent throughout
the community, and mothers were wont
to frighten their young offspring into obedience
with threats of the &#8220;san-tor-i-yum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what do you reckon ails <i>him</i>?&#8221;
asked the blacksmith of the stage-driver, as
Harlan went into the village store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t reckon nothin&#8217; ailed him to
look at him, would you?&#8221; queried the driver,
in reply.</p>
<p>Indeed, no one looking at Mr. Carr would
have suspected him of an &#8220;ailment.&#8221; He was
tall and broad-shouldered and well set up,
with clear grey eyes and a rosy, smooth-shaven,
boyish face which had given him
the nickname of &#8220;The Cherub&#8221; all along
Newspaper Row. In his bearing there was
a suggestion of boundless energy, which
needed only proper direction to accomplish
wonders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t never tell,&#8221; continued the driver,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
shifting his quid. &#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve took folks up
there goin&#8217; on ten year now, an&#8217; some I&#8217;ve
took up looked considerable more healthy than
I be when I took &#8217;em up. Comin&#8217; back, howsumever,
it was different. One young feller
rode up with me in the rain one night, a-singin&#8217;
an&#8217; a-whistlin&#8217; to beat the band, an&#8217;
when I took him back, a month or so arterward,
he had a striped nurse on one side of
him an&#8217; a doctor on t&#8217; other, an&#8217; was wearin&#8217;
a shawl. Couldn&#8217;t hardly set up, but he was
a-tryin&#8217; to joke just the same. &#8216;Hank,&#8217; says
he, when we got a little way off from the
place, &#8216;my book of life has been edited by the
librarians an&#8217; the entire appendix removed.&#8217;
Them&#8217;s his very words. &#8216;An&#8217;,&#8217; says he, &#8216;the
time to have the appendix took out is before
it does much of anythin&#8217; to your table of
contents.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor shut him up then, an&#8217; I didn&#8217;t
hear no more, but I remembered the language,
an&#8217; arterwards, when I got a chanst, I looked
in the school-teacher&#8217;s dictionary. It said as
how the appendix was sunthin&#8217; appended or
added to, but I couldn&#8217;t get no more about it.
I&#8217;ve hearn tell of a &#8216;devil child&#8217; with a tail to
it what was travellin&#8217; with the circus one year,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
an&#8217; I&#8217;ve surmised as how mebbe a tail had
begun to grow on this young feller an&#8217; it was
took off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; ejaculated the blacksmith.</p>
<p>By reason of his professional connection
with the sanitarium, Mr. Henry Blake was, in
a sense, the oracle of Judson Centre, and he
enjoyed his proud distinction to the full. Ordinarily,
he was taciturn, but the present hour
found him in a conversational mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s married,&#8221; he went on, returning to
the original subject. &#8220;I took him an&#8217; his wife
up to the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern last night. Come
in on the nine forty-seven from the Junction.
Reckon they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to stay a spell, &#8217;cause
they&#8217;ve got trunks&mdash;one of a reasonable size,
an&#8217; &#8217;nother that looks like a dog-house. Box,
too, that&#8217;s got lead in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Books, maybe,&#8221; suggested the blacksmith,
with unexpected discernment. &#8220;Schoolteacher
boarded to our house wunst an&#8217; she
had most a car-load of &#8217;em. Educated folks
has to have books to keep from losin&#8217; their
education.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take much stock in it myself,&#8221; remarked
the driver. &#8220;It spiles most folks.
As soon as they get some, they begin to pine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
an&#8217; hanker for more. I knowed a feller wunst
that begun with one book dropped on the
road near the sanitarium, an&#8217; he never stopped
till he was plum through college. An&#8217; a
woman up there sent my darter a book wunst,
an&#8217; I took it right back to her. &#8216;My darter&#8217;s got a book,&#8217;
says I, &#8216;an&#8217; she ain&#8217;t a-needin&#8217; of
no duplicates. Keep it,&#8217; says I, &#8216;fer somebody
that ain&#8217;t got no book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon,&#8221; asked the blacksmith,
after a long silence, &#8220;that they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to live
in the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-sayin&#8217;,&#8221; answered Mr. Blake, cautiously.
&#8220;They&#8217;re educated, an&#8217; there&#8217;s no
tellin&#8217; what educated folks is goin&#8217; to do.
This young lady, now, that come up with
him last night, she said it was &#8216;a dear old
place an&#8217; she loved it a&#8217;ready.&#8217; Them&#8217;s her
very words!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s c&#8217;rrect, an&#8217; as I said before, when
you&#8217;re dealin&#8217; with educated folks, you&#8217;re
swimmin&#8217; in deep water with the shore clean
out o&#8217; sight. Education was what ailed him.&#8221;
By a careless nod Mr. Blake indicated the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern,
which could be seen from the main
thoroughfare of Judson Centre.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve hearn,&#8221; he went on, taking a fresh
bite from his morning purchase of &#8220;plug,&#8221;
&#8220;that he had one hull room mighty nigh plum
full o&#8217; nothin&#8217; but books, an&#8217; there was always
more comin&#8217; by freight an&#8217; express an&#8217; through
the post-office. It&#8217;s all on account o&#8217; them
books that he&#8217;s made the front o&#8217; his house into
what it is. My wife had a paper book wunst,
a-tellin&#8217; &#8216;How to Transfer a Hopeless Exterior,&#8217;
with pictures of houses in it like they be here an&#8217;
more arter they&#8217;d been transferred. You bet I
burnt it while she was gone to sewin&#8217; circle, an&#8217;
there ain&#8217;t no book come into my house since.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake spoke with the virtuous air of
one who has protected his home from contamination.
Indeed, as he had often said
before, &#8220;you can&#8217;t never tell what folks&#8217;ll do
when books gets a holt of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon,&#8221; asked the blacksmith,
&#8220;that there&#8217;ll be company?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Company,&#8221; snickered Mr. Blake, &#8220;oh, my
Lord, yes! A little thing like death ain&#8217;t never
going to keep company away. Ain&#8217;t you
never hearn as how misery loves company?
The more miserable you are the more company
you&#8217;ll have, an&#8217; vice versey, etcetery an&#8217;
the same.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; warned the blacksmith, in a harsh
whisper. &#8220;He&#8217;s a-comin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;City feller,&#8221; grumbled Mr. Blake, affecting
not to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; said Harlan, pleasantly,
though not without an air of condescension.
&#8220;Can you tell me where I can find the stage-driver?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; grunted Mr. Blake. &#8220;Be
you wantin&#8217; anythin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to pay you for taking us up to the
house last night, and to arrange about our
trunks. Can you deliver them this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t a-runnin&#8217; of no livery, but I can take
&#8217;em up, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re wantin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;and the box, too,
if you will. And the things I&#8217;ve just ordered
at the grocery&mdash;can you bring them, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake nodded helplessly, and the blacksmith
gazed at Harlan, open-mouthed, as he
started uphill. &#8220;Must sure have a ailment,&#8221;
he commented, &#8220;but I hear tell, Hank, that in
the city they never carry nothin&#8217; round with
&#8217;em but perhaps an umbrell. Everythin&#8217; else
they have &#8216;sent.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon it&#8217;s true enough. I took a ham
wunst up to the sanitarium for a young sprig
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
of a doctor that was too proud to carry it himself.
He was goin&#8217; that way, too&mdash;walkin&#8217; up
to save money&mdash;so I charged him for carryin&#8217;
up the ham just what I&#8217;d have took both for.
&#8216;Pigs is high,&#8217; I told him, &#8216;same price for
one as for &#8217;nother,&#8217; but he didn&#8217;t pay no attention
to it an&#8217; never raised no kick about the
price. Thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout sunthin&#8217; else, most likely&mdash;most
of &#8217;em are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan, most assuredly, was &#8220;thinkin&#8217; &#8217;bout
sunthin&#8217; else.&#8221; In fact, he was possessed by
portentous uneasiness. There was well-defined
doubt in his mind regarding his reception
at the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern. Dorothy&#8217;s parting
words had been plain&mdash;almost to the point of
rudeness, he reflected, unhappily, and he was
not sure that &#8220;a brute&#8221; would be allowed in
her presence again.</p>
<p>The bare, uncurtained windows gave no
sign of human occupancy. Perhaps she had
left him! Then his reason came to the rescue&mdash;there
was no way for her to go but downhill,
and he would certainly have seen her had
she taken that path.</p>
<p>When he entered the yard, he smelled
smoke, and ran wildly into the house. A
hasty search through all the rooms revealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
nothing&mdash;even Dorothy had disappeared.
From the kitchen window, he saw her in the
back yard, poking idly through a heap of
smouldering rubbish with an old broomstick.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; he demanded,
breathlessly, before she knew he was near
her.</p>
<p>Dorothy turned, disguising her sudden start
by a toss of her head. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, coolly,
&#8220;it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan bit his lips and his eyes laughed. &#8220;I
say, Dorothy,&#8221; he began, awkwardly; &#8220;I was
rather a beast, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; she returned, in a small, unnatural
voice, still poking through the ruins.
&#8220;I told you so, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe you at the time,&#8221; Harlan
went on, eager to make amends, &#8220;but I do
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221; Mrs. Carr&#8217;s tone was not
at all reassuring.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause, then Harlan,
putting aside his obstinate pride, said the
simple sentence which men of all ages have
found it hardest to say&mdash;perhaps because it is
the sign of utter masculine abasement. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, dear, will you forgive me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>In a moment, she was in his arms. &#8220;It
was partly my fault,&#8221; she admitted, generously,
from the depths of his coat collar. &#8220;I
think there must be something in the atmosphere
of the house. We never quarrelled
before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we never will again,&#8221; answered
Harlan, confidently. &#8220;What have you been
burning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a mattress,&#8221; whispered Dorothy,
much ashamed. &#8220;I tried to get a bed out,
but it was too heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You funny, funny girl! How did you
ever get a mattress out, all alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dragged it to an upper window and
dumped it,&#8221; she explained, blushing, &#8220;then
came down and dragged it some more.
Claudius Tiberius didn&#8217;t like to have me do
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; laughed Harlan. &#8220;That
is,&#8221; he added hastily, &#8220;he couldn&#8217;t have
been pleased to see you doing it all by yourself.
Anybody would love to see a mattress
burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we get some more? There are
plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not take all our pleasure at once,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
suggested, with rare tact. &#8220;One mattress a
day&mdash;how&#8217;ll that do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have it at night,&#8221; cried Dorothy,
clapping her hands, &#8220;and when the mattresses
are all gone, we&#8217;ll do the beds and bureaus
and the haircloth furniture in the parlour. Oh,
I do so love a bonfire!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s heart grew strangely tender, for it
had been this underlying childishness in her
that he had loved the most. She was stirring
the ashes now, with as much real pleasure as
though she were five instead of twenty-five.</p>
<p>As it happened, Harlan would have been
saved a great deal of trouble if he had followed
out her suggestion and burned all of the beds
in the house except two or three, but the
balance between foresight and retrospection
has seldom been exact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beast of a smudge you&#8217;re making,&#8221; he
commented, choking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get around to the other side, then. Why,
Harlan, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to a small metal box in the
midst of the ashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poem on Spring, probably, put into the
corner-stone by the builder of the mattress.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish,&#8221; she said, with assumed
severity. &#8220;Get me a pail of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>With two sticks they lifted it into the water
and waited, impatiently enough, until they
were sure it was cool. Then Dorothy, asserting
her right of discovery, opened it with
trembling fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why-ee!&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>Upon a bed of wet cotton lay a large
brooch, made wholly of clustered diamonds,
and a coral necklace, somewhat injured by the
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose is it?&#8221; demanded Dorothy, when
she recovered the faculty of speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say,&#8221; returned Harlan, after due
deliberation, &#8220;that it belonged to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After this,&#8221; she said, slowly, her eyes
wide with wonder, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take everything
apart before we burn it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan was turning the brooch over in his
hand and roughly estimating its value at two
thousand dollars. &#8220;Here&#8217;s something on the
back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;&#8216;R. from E., March 12,
1865.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rebecca from Ebeneezer,&#8221; cried Dorothy.
&#8220;Oh, Harlan, it&#8217;s ours! Don&#8217;t you remember
the letter said: &#8216;my house and all its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
contents to my beloved nephew, James Harlan
Carr&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; said Harlan. But his conscience
was uneasy, none the less.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>The First Caller</h3>
</div>

<p>As Mr. Blake had heard, there was &#8220;one
hull room mighty nigh plum full o&#8217;
nothin&#8217; but books&#8221;; a grievous waste, indeed,
when one already &#8220;had a book.&#8221; It was the
front room, opposite the parlour, and every
door and window in it could be securely
bolted from the inside. If any one desired
unbroken privacy, it could be had in the
library as nowhere else in the house.</p>
<p>The book-shelves were made of rough
pine, unplaned, unpainted, and were scarcely
a seemly setting for the treasure they bore.
But in looking at the books, one perceived
that their owner had been one who passed
by the body in his eager search for the soul.</p>
<p>Here were no fine editions, no luxurious,
costly volumes in full levant. Illuminated
pages, rubricated headings, and fine illustrations
were conspicuous by their absence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
For the most part, the books were simply
but serviceably bound in plain cloth covers.
Many a paper-covered book had been bound
by its purchaser in pasteboard, flimsy enough
in quality, yet further strengthened by cloth
at the back. Cheap, pirated editions were
so many that Harlan wondered whether his
uncle had not been wholly without conscience
in the matter of book-buying.</p>
<p>Shelf after shelf stretched across the long
wall, with its company of mute consolers
whose master was no more. The fine flowering
of the centuries, like a single precious
drop of imperishable perfume, was hidden in
this rude casket. The minds and hearts of
the great, laid pitilessly bare, were here in
this one room, shielded merely by pasteboard
and cloth.</p>
<p>Far up in the mountains, amid snow-clad
steeps and rock-bound fastnesses, one finds,
perchance, a shell. It is so small a thing that
it can be held in the hollow of the hand; so
frail that a slight pressure of the finger will
crush it to atoms, yet, held to the ear, it
brings the surge and sweep of that vast,
primeval ocean which, in the inconceivably
remote past, covered the peak. And so, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the eye of the mind, the small brown book,
with its hundred printed pages, brings back
the whole story of the world.</p>
<p>A thin, piping voice, to which its fellows
have paid no heed, after a time becomes
silent, and, ceaselessly marching, the years
pass on by. Yet that trembling old hand,
quietly laid at last upon the turbulent heart,
in the solitude of a garret has guided a pen,
and the manuscript is left. Ragged, worn,
blotted, spotted with candle drippings and
endlessly interlined, why should these few
sheets of paper be saved?</p>
<p>Because, as it happens, the only record of
the period is there&mdash;a record so significant
that fifty years can be reconstructed, as an
entire language was brought to light by a triple
inscription upon a single stone. Thrown like
the shell upon Time&#8217;s ever-receding shore, it
is, nevertheless, the means by which unborn
thousands shall commune with him who
wrote in his garret, see his whole life mirrored
in his book, know his philosophy, and
take home his truth. For by way of the
printed page comes Immortality.</p>
<p>There was no book in the library which
had not been read many times. Some were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
falling apart, and others had been carefully
sewn together and awkwardly rebound. Still
open, on a rickety table in the corner, was
that ponderous volume with an extremely
limited circulation: <i>The Publishers&#8217; Trade
List Annual</i>. Pencilled crosses here and
there indicated books to be purchased, or at
least sent on approval, to &#8220;customers known
to the House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;when it&#8217;s
raining and we can&#8217;t go out, we&#8217;ll take down
all these books, arrange them in something
like order, and catalogue them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How optimistic you are!&#8221; remarked Harlan.
&#8220;Do you think it could be done in one
day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; returned Dorothy; &#8220;you
know what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan paced restlessly back and forth,
pausing now and then to look out of the window,
where nothing much was to be seen
except the orchard, at a little distance from
the house, and Claudius Tiberius, sunning
himself pleasantly upon the porch. Four
weeks had been a pleasant vacation, but two
weeks of comparative idleness, added to it,
were too much for an active mind and body
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
to endure. Three or four times he had tried
to begin the book that was to bring fame
and fortune, and as many times had failed.
Hitherto Harlan&#8217;s work had not been obliged
to wait for inspiration, and it was not so easy
as it had seemed the day he bade his managing
editor farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody is coming,&#8221; announced Dorothy,
from the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! Nobody ever comes here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A precedent is about to be established,
then. I feel it in my bones that we&#8217;re going
to have company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see.&#8221; Harlan went to the window
and looked over her shoulder. A little man
in a huge silk hat was toiling up the hill,
aided by a cane. He was bent and old,
yet he moved with a certain briskness, and,
as Dorothy had said, he was inevitably
coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in thunder&mdash;&#8221; began Harlan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first company,&#8221; interrupted Dorothy,
with her hand over his mouth. &#8220;The very
first person who has called on us since we
were married!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except Claudius Tiberius,&#8221; amended Harlan.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t a cat anybody?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Claudius is. I beg his imperial pardon for
forgetting him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rusty bell-wire creaked, then a timid
ring came from the rear depths of the house.
&#8220;You let him in,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
go and fix my hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I right,&#8221; queried the old gentleman,
when Harlan opened the door, &#8220;in presuming
that I am so fortunate as to address Mr. James
Harlan Carr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Carr,&#8221; answered Harlan, politely.
&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; answered the visitor, in high
staccato, oblivious of the fact that Claudius
Tiberius had scooted in between his feet; &#8220;it
will be my pleasure to claim your hospitality
for a few brief moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; he went on, as Harlan
ushered him into the parlour, &#8220;to be able to
make your acquaintance before this, but my
multitudinous duties&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He fumbled in his pocket and produced a
card, cut somewhat irregularly from a sheet of
white cardboard, and bearing in tremulous
autographic script: &#8220;Jeremiah Bradford,
Counsellor at Law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;it was you who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
wrote me the letter. I should have hunted
you up when I first came, shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; returned Mr. Bradford. &#8220;It
is I who have been remiss. It is etiquette that
the old residents should call first upon the
newcomers. Many and varied duties in connection
with the practice of my profession
have hitherto&mdash;&#8221; His eyes sought the portrait
over the mantel. &#8220;A most excellent
likeness of your worthy uncle,&#8221; he continued,
irrelevantly, &#8220;a gentleman with whom, as I
understand, you never had the pleasure and
privilege of becoming acquainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never met Uncle Ebeneezer,&#8221; rejoined
Harlan, &#8220;but mother told me a great deal
about him and we had one or two pictures&mdash;daguerreotypes,
I believe they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly, my dear sir. This portrait
was painted from his very last daguerreotype
by an artist of renown. It is a wonderful
likeness. He was my Colonel&mdash;I served
under him in the war. It was my desire to
possess a portrait of him in uniform, but he
would never consent, and would not allow
anyone save myself to address him as Colonel.
An eccentric, but very estimable gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot understand,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
he should have left the house to me. I had
never even seen him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; smiled Mr. Bradford, enigmatically,
&#8220;that was his reason, or rather, perhaps
I should say, if you had known your
uncle more intimately and had visited him
here, or, if he had had the privilege of knowing
you&mdash;quite often, as you know, a personal
acquaintance proves disappointing, though,
of course, in this case&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The old gentleman was floundering helplessly
when Harlan rescued him. &#8220;I want
you to meet my wife, Mr. Bradford. If you
will excuse me, I will call her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left to himself, the visitor slipped back and
forth uneasily upon his haircloth chair, and
took occasion to observe Claudius Tiberius,
who sat near by and regarded the guest unblinkingly.
Hearing approaching footsteps,
he took out his worn silk handkerchief, unfolded
it, and wiped the cold perspiration
from his legal brow. In his heart of hearts,
he wished he had not come, but Dorothy&#8217;s
kindly greeting at once relieved him of all
embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been wondering,&#8221; she said,
brightly, &#8220;who would be the first to call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
upon us, and you have come at exactly the
right time. New residents are always given
two weeks, are they not, in which to get
settled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so, my dear madam, quite so, and
I trust that you are by this time fully accustomed
to your changed environment. Judson
Centre, while possessing few metropolitan
advantages, has distinct and peculiar recommendations
of an individual character which
endear the locality to those residing therein.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall like it here,&#8221; said Dorothy.
&#8220;At least I shall try to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A very commendable spirit,&#8221; rejoined the
old gentleman, warmly, &#8220;and rather remarkable
in one so young.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr graciously acknowledged the compliment,
and the guest flushed with pleasure.
To perception less fine, there would have
been food for unseemly mirth in his attire.
Never in all her life before had Dorothy seen
rough cow-hide boots, and grey striped
trousers worn with a rusty and moth-eaten
dress-coat in the middle of the afternoon. An
immaculate expanse of shirt-front and a general
air of extreme cleanliness went far toward
redeeming the unfamiliar costume. The silk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
hat, with a bell-shaped crown and wide, rolling
brim, belonged to a much earlier period,
and had been brushed to look like new.
Even Harlan noted that the ravelled edges
of his linen had been carefully trimmed and
the worn binding of the hat brim inked
wherever necessary.</p>
<p>His wrinkled old face was kindly, though
somewhat sad. His weak blue eyes were
sheltered by an enormous pair of spectacles,
which he took off and wiped continually. He
was smooth-shaven and his scanty hair was
as white as the driven snow. Now, as he
sat in Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s parlour, he seemed
utterly friendless and forlorn&mdash;a complete
failure of that pitiful type which never for a
moment guesses that it has failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be my delight,&#8221; the old man was
saying, his hollow cheeks faintly flushed, &#8220;to
see that the elite of Judson Centre pay proper
respect to you at an early date. If I were
not most unfortunately a single gentleman, my
wife would do herself the honour of calling
upon you immediately and of tendering you
some sort of hospitality approximately commensurate
with your worth. As it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As it is,&#8221; said Harlan, taking up the wandering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
thread of the discourse, &#8220;that particular
pleasure must be on our side. We both
hope that you will come often, and informally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a solace to me,&#8221; rejoined the
old gentleman, tremulously, &#8220;to find the
niece and nephew of my departed friend both
congenial and companionable. He was my
Colonel&mdash;I served under him in the war&mdash;and
until the last, he allowed me to address him
as Colonel&mdash;a privilege accorded to no one
else. He very seldom left his own estate, but
at his request I often spent an evening or a
Sunday afternoon in his society, and after his
untimely death, I feel the loss of his companionship
very keenly. He was my Colonel&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should imagine so,&#8221; said Harlan, kindly,
&#8220;though, as I have told you, I never knew
him at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A much-misunderstood gentleman,&#8221; continued
Mr. Bradford, carefully wiping his spectacles.
&#8220;My grief is too recent, at present,
to enable me to discourse freely of his many
virtues, but at some future time I shall hope
to make you acquainted with your benefactor.
He was my Colonel, and in serving
under him in the war, I had an unusual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
opportunity to know him as he really was.
May I ask, without intruding upon your private
affairs, whether or not it is your intention to
reside here permanently?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not made up our minds,&#8221; responded
Harlan. &#8220;We shall stay here this
Summer, anyway, as I have some work to do
which can be done only in a quiet place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quiet!&#8221; muttered the old gentleman,
&#8220;quiet place! If I might venture to suggest,
I should think you would find any other
season more agreeable for prolonged mental
effort. In Summer there are distractions&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Dorothy, &#8220;in Summer, one
wants to be outdoors, and I am going to keep
chickens and a cow, but my husband hopes
to have his book finished by September.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His book!&#8221; repeated Mr. Bradford, in
genuine astonishment. &#8220;Am I actually addressing
an author?&#8221;</p>
<p>He beamed upon Harlan in a way which
that modest youth found positively disconcerting.</p>
<p>&#8220;A would-be author only,&#8221; laughed Harlan,
the colour mounting to his temples.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve done newspaper work heretofore, and
now I&#8217;m going to try something else.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said Mr. Bradford, rising, &#8220;I
must really beg the privilege of clasping
your hand. It is a great honour for Judson
Centre to have an author residing in its
midst!&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking pity upon Harlan, Dorothy hastened
to change the subject. &#8220;We hope it may
be,&#8221; she observed, lightly, &#8220;and I wonder,
Mr. Bradford, if you could not give me some
good advice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted, my dear madam.
Any knowledge I may possess is trebly at
your service, for the sake of the distinguished
author whose wife you have the honour to be,
for the sake of your departed relative, who was
my friend, my Colonel, and last, but not least,
for your own sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only about a maid,&#8221; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;A &mdash;&mdash; my dear madam, I beg your pardon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A maid,&#8221; repeated Dorothy; &#8220;a servant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! A hired girl, or more accurately, in
the parlance of Judson Centre, the help. Do
I understand that it is your desire to become
an employer of help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; answered Dorothy, somewhat awed
by the solemnity of his tone, &#8220;if help is to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
found. I thought you might know where I
could get some one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I might be permitted to suggest,&#8221; replied
Mr. Bradford, after due deliberation, &#8220;I
should unhesitatingly recommend Mrs. Sarah
Smithers, who did for your uncle during the
entire period of his residence here and whose
privilege it was to close his eyes in his last
sleep. She is at present without prospect of a
situation, and I believe would be very ready
to accept a new position, especially so desirable
a position as this, in your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Could you&mdash;could you send
her to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall do so, most assuredly, providing
she is willing to come, and should she chance
not to be agreeably disposed toward so pleasing
a project, it will be my happiness to endeavour
to persuade her.&#8221; Drawing out a
memorandum book and a pencil, the old gentleman
made an entry upon a fresh page.
&#8220;The multitudinous duties in connection with
the practice of my profession,&#8221; he began&mdash;&#8220;there,
my dear madam, it is already attended
to, since it is placed quite out of my
power to forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am greatly obliged,&#8221; said Dorothy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; continued the visitor, &#8220;I must
go. I fear I have already outstayed the limitation
of a formal visit, such as the first should
be, and it is not my desire to intrude upon an
author&#8217;s time. Moreover, my own duties,
slight and unimportant as they are in comparison,
must ultimately press upon my attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come again,&#8221; said Harlan, kindly, following
him to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be my great pleasure,&#8221; rejoined the
guest, &#8220;not only on your own account, but
because your personality reminds me of that
of my departed friend. You favour him considerably,
more particularly in the eyes, if I
may be permitted to allude to details. I think
I told you, did I not, that he was my Colonel
and I was privileged to serve under him in the
war? My&mdash;oh, I walked, did I not? I remember
that it was my intention to come in a
carriage, as being more suitable to a formal
visit, but Mr. Blake had other engagements
for his vehicle. Dear sir and madam, I bid
you good afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, he went downhill, briskly
enough, yet stumbling where the way was
rough. They watched him until the bobbing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
bell-shaped crown of the ancient head-gear
was completely out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a dear old man!&#8221; said Dorothy.
&#8220;He&#8217;s lonely and we must have him come
up often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; asked Harlan, &#8220;that I look
like Uncle Ebeneezer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you don&#8217;t!&#8221; cried Dorothy, &#8220;and
that reminds me. I want to take that picture
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To burn it?&#8221; inquired Harlan, slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t burn it,&#8221; answered Dorothy,
somewhat spitefully, &#8220;but there&#8217;s no
law against putting it in the attic, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of. Can we reach it
from a chair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they mounted one of the haircloth
monuments, slipping, as Dorothy said, until
it was like walking on ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then,&#8221; said Harlan, gaily, &#8220;come on
down, Uncle! You&#8217;re about to be moved
into the attic!&#8221;</p>
<p>The picture lunged forward, almost before
they had touched it, the heavy gilt frame
bruising Dorothy&#8217;s cheek badly. In catching
it, Harlan turned it completely around,
then gave a low whistle of astonishment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Pasted securely to the back was a fearsome
skull and cross-bones, made on wrapping
paper with a brush and India ink. Below it,
in great capitals, was the warning inscription:
&#8220;LET MY PICTURE ALONE!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do with it?&#8221; asked Harlan,
endeavouring to laugh, though, as he
afterward admitted, he &#8220;felt creepy.&#8221; &#8220;Shall
I take it up to the attic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Dorothy, in a small, unnatural
voice, &#8220;leave it where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Harlan was putting it back, Dorothy,
trembling from head to foot, crept around to
the back of the easel which bore Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s
portrait. She was not at all surprised
to find, on the back of it, a notice to this
effect: &#8220;ANYONE DARING TO MOVE
MRS. JUDSON&#8217;S PICTURE WILL BE
HAUNTED FOR LIFE BY US BOTH.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; said Dorothy, somewhat
viciously, when Harlan had joined her.
&#8220;What kind of a woman do you suppose
she could have been, to marry him? I&#8217;ll bet
she&#8217;s glad she&#8217;s dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy was still wiping blood from her
face and might not have been wholly unprejudiced.
Aunt Rebecca was a gentle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
sweet-faced woman, if her portrait told the
truth, possessed of all the virtues save self-assertion
and dominated by habitual, unselfish
kindness to others. She could not have
been discourteous even to Claudius Tiberius,
who at this moment was seated in state upon
the sofa and purring industriously.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>Finances</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve ordered the typewriter,&#8221; said
Dorothy, brightly, &#8220;and some nice
new note-paper, and a seal. I&#8217;ve just been
reading about making virtue out of necessity,
so I&#8217;ve ordered &#8216;At the Sign of the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern&#8217;
put on our stationery, in gold, and
a yellow pumpkin on the envelope flap, just
above the seal. And I want you to make a
funny sign-board to flap from a pole, the way
they did in &#8216;Rudder Grange.&#8217; If you could
make a wooden Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern, we could
have a candle inside it at night, and then the
sign would be just like the house. We can
get the paint and things down in the village.
Won&#8217;t it be cute? We&#8217;re farmers, now,
so we&#8217;ll have to pretend we like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan repressed an exclamation, which
could not have been wholly inspired by
pleasure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Dorothy,
easily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you like the design for the
note-paper? If you don&#8217;t, you won&#8217;t have to
use it. Nobody&#8217;s going to make you write
letters on paper you don&#8217;t like, so cheer up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the paper,&#8221; answered Harlan,
miserably; &#8220;it&#8217;s the typewriter.&#8221; Up to the
present moment, sustained by a false, but
none the less determined pride, he had refrained
from taking his wife into his confidence
regarding his finances. With characteristic
masculine short-sightedness, he had failed to
perceive that every moment of delay made
matters worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I inquire,&#8221; asked Mrs. Carr, coolly,
&#8220;what is wrong with the typewriter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; sighed Harlan, &#8220;except
that we can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; The whole bitter
truth was out, now, and he turned away
wretchedly, ashamed to meet her eyes.</p>
<p>It seemed ages before she spoke. Then she
said, in smooth, icy tones: &#8220;What was your
object in offering to get it for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke impulsively,&#8221; explained Harlan,
forgetting that he had never suggested buying
a typewriter. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t stop to think. I&#8217;m
sorry,&#8221; he concluded, lamely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you spoke impulsively,&#8221;
snapped Dorothy, &#8220;when you asked me to
marry you. You&#8217;re sorry for that, too, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not the only one who&#8217;s sorry,&#8221;
she rejoined, her cheeks flushed and her eyes
blazing. &#8220;I had no idea what an expense I
was going to be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy!&#8221; cried Harlan, angrily; &#8220;you
didn&#8217;t think I was a millionaire, did you?
Were you under the impression that I was an
active branch of the United States Mint?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered, huskily; &#8220;I merely
thought I was marrying a gentleman instead
of a loafer, and I beg your pardon for the mistake!&#8221;
She slammed the door on the last
word, and he heard her light feet pattering
swiftly down the hall, little guessing that she
was trying to gain the shelter of her own
room before giving way to a tempest of sobs.</p>
<p>Happy are they who can drown all pain, sorrow,
and disappointment in a copious flood
of tears. In an hour, at the most, Dorothy
would be her sunny self again, penitent, and
wholly ashamed of her undignified outburst.
By to-morrow she would have forgotten it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
but Harlan, made of sterner clay, would remember
it for days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loafer!&#8221; The cruel word seemed written
accusingly on every wall of the room. In
a sudden flash of insight he perceived the
truth of it&mdash;and it hurt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months,&#8221; bethought; &#8220;two months
of besotted idleness. And I used to chase
news from the Battery to the Bronx every
day from eight to six! Murders, smallpox,
East Side scraps, and Tammany Hall. Why
in the hereafter can&#8217;t they have a fire at the
sanitarium, or something that I can wire
in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Temple of Healing,&#8221; as Dorothy had
christened it in a happier moment, stood on a
distant hill, all but hidden now by trees and
shrubbery. A column of smoke curled lazily
upward against the blue, but there was no
immediate prospect of a fire of the &#8220;news&#8221;
variety.</p>
<p>Harlan stood at the window for a long time,
deeply troubled. The call of the city dinned
relentlessly into his ears. Oh, for an hour in
the midst of it, with the rumble and roar and
clatter of ceaseless traffic, the hurrying, heedless
throng rushing in every direction, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
glare of the sun on the many-windowed cliffs,
the fever of the struggle in his veins!</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;was two months so long, when a
fellow was just married, and hadn&#8217;t had more
than a day at a time off for six years? Since
the &#8220;cub reporter&#8221; was first &#8220;licked into
shape&#8221; in the office of <i>The Thunderer</i>, there
had been plenty of work for him, year in and
year out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;if the old man
would take me back on my job?</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see &#8217;em in the office now,&#8221; went on
Harlan, mentally, &#8220;when I go back and tell
&#8217;em I want my place again. The old man
will look up and say: &#8216;The hell you do!
Thought you&#8217;d accepted a position on the
literary circuit as manager of the nine muses!
Better run along and look after &#8217;em before
they join the union.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the exchange man will yell at me not
to slam the door as I go out, and I&#8217;ll be
pointed out to the newest kid as a horrible
example of misdirected ambition. Brinkman
will say: &#8216;Sonny, there&#8217;s a bloke that got
too good for his job and now he&#8217;s come
back, willing to edit The Mother&#8217;s Corner.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be about the same in the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
offices, too,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;&#8216;Sorry, nothing
to-day, but there might be next month. Drop
in again sometime after six weeks or so and
meanwhile I&#8217;ll let you know if anything turns
up. Yes, I can remember your address.
Don&#8217;t slam the door as you go out. Most
people seem to have been born in a barn.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he continued to himself, fiercely,
&#8220;what is there in it? They&#8217;ll take your
youth, all your strength and energy, and give
you a measly living in exchange. They&#8217;ll fill
you with excitement till you&#8217;re never good
for anything else, any more than a cavalry
horse is fitted to pull a vegetable wagon.
Then, when you&#8217;re old, they&#8217;ve got no use
for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before his mental vision, in pitiful array,
came that unhappy procession of hacks that
files, day in and day out, along Newspaper
Row, drawn by every instinct to the arena
that holds nothing for them but a meagre, uncertain
pittance, dwindling slowly to charity.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d be at the last of it,&#8221;
muttered Harlan, savagely, &#8220;with even the
cubs offering me the price of a drink to get
out. And Dorothy&mdash;good God! Where
would Dorothy be?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>He clenched his fists and marched up and
down the room in utter despair. &#8220;Why,&#8221;
he breathed, &#8220;why wasn&#8217;t I taught to do
something honest, instead of being cursed
with this itch to write? A carpenter, a bricklayer,
a stone-mason,&mdash;any one of &#8217;em has a
better chance than I!&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, even then, Harlan saw clearly
that save where some vast cathedral reared its
unnumbered spires, the mason and the bricklayer
were without significance; that even
the builders were remembered only because
of the great uses to which their buildings
were put. &#8220;That, too, through print,&#8221; he
murmured. &#8220;It all comes down to the
printed page at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a table, near by, was a sheaf of rough
copy paper, and six or eight carefully sharpened
pencils&mdash;the dull, meaningless stone
waiting for the flint that should strike it into
flame. Day after day the table had stood by
the window, without result, save in Harlan&#8217;s
uneasy conscience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only a tramp,&#8221; he said, aloud, &#8220;and
I&#8217;ve known it, all along.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat down by the table and took up a
pencil, but no words came. Remorsefully, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
wrote to an acquaintance&mdash;a man who had a
book published every year and filled in the
intervening time with magazine work and
newspaper specials. He sealed the letter and
addressed it idly, then tossed it aside purposelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Loafer!&#8221; The memory of it stung him
like a lash, and, completely overwhelmed
with shame, he hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a pair of soft arms stole around his
neck, a childish, tear-wet cheek was pressed
close to his, and a sweet voice whispered,
tenderly: &#8220;Dear, I&#8217;m sorry! I&#8217;m so sorry
I can&#8217;t live another minute unless you tell me
you forgive me!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Am I really a loafer?&#8221; asked Harlan, half
an hour later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you&#8217;re not,&#8221; answered Dorothy,
her trustful eyes looking straight into his;
&#8220;you&#8217;re absolutely the most adorable boy in
the whole world, and it&#8217;s me that knows it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you know it,&#8221; returned Harlan,
seriously, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care a hang what other
people think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, tell me,&#8221; continued Dorothy, &#8220;how
near are we to being broke?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>Obediently, Harlan turned his pockets inside
out and piled his worldly wealth on the
table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three hundred and seventy-four dollars
and sixteen cents,&#8221; she said, when she had
finished counting. &#8220;Why, we&#8217;re almost
rich, and a little while ago you tried to make
me think we were poor!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all I have, Dorothy&mdash;every blooming
cent, except one dollar in the savings bank.
Sort of a nest egg I had left,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; she said, reaching down
into her collar and drawing up a loop of worn
ribbon. &#8220;Straight front corset,&#8221; she observed,
flushing, &#8220;makes a nice pocket for
almost everything.&#8221; She drew up a chamois-skin
bag, of an unprepossessing mouse colour,
and emptied out a roll of bills. &#8220;Two hundred
and twelve dollars,&#8221; she said, proudly,
&#8220;and eighty-three cents and four postage
stamps in my purse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved it,&#8221; she continued, hastily, &#8220;for
an emergency, and I wanted some silk stockings
and a French embroidered corset and
some handmade lingerie worse than you can
ever know. Wasn&#8217;t I a brave, heroic, noble
woman?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you were,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;but, Dorothy,
you know I can&#8217;t touch your money!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because&mdash;because it isn&#8217;t right.
Do you think I&#8217;m cad enough to live on a
woman&#8217;s earnings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; said Dorothy, kindly, &#8220;don&#8217;t be
a fool. You&#8217;ll take my whole heart and soul
and life&mdash;all that I have been and all that I&#8217;m
going to be&mdash;and be glad to get it, and now
you&#8217;re balking at ten cents that I happened to
have in my stocking when I took the fatal
step.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear heart, don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s different&mdash;tremendously
different. Can&#8217;t you see that it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that I&#8217;m not worth as much
as two hundred and twelve dollars and eighty-three
cents and four postage stamps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Darling, you&#8217;re worth more than all the
rest of the world put together. Don&#8217;t talk to
me like that. But I can&#8217;t touch your money,
truly, dear, I can&#8217;t; so don&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Idiot,&#8221; cried Dorothy, with tears raining
down her face, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know I&#8217;d go with
you if you had to grind an organ in the street,
and collect the money for you in a tin cup till
we got enough for a monkey? What kind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
of a dinky little silver-plated wedding present
do you think I am, anyway? You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of it was sobbed out, incoherently
enough, on his hitherto immaculate shirt-front.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mind,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;if I cry
down your neck, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to cry,&#8221; he answered,
his voice trembling, &#8220;this is the one place
for you to do it, but I don&#8217;t want you to
cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, then,&#8221; she said, wiping her eyes
on a wet and crumpled handkerchief. In a
time astonishingly brief to one hitherto unfamiliar
with the lachrymal function, her sobs
had ceased.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made me cry nearly a quart since
morning,&#8221; she went on, with assumed
severity, &#8220;and I hope you&#8217;ll behave so well
from now on that I&#8217;ll never have to do it
again. Look here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led him to the window, where a pair of
robins were building a nest in the boughs of a
maple close by. &#8220;Do you see those birds?&#8221;
she demanded, pointing at them with a dimpled,
rosy forefinger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, what of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re married, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope they are,&#8221; laughed Harlan, &#8220;or at
least engaged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s bringing the straw and feathers
for the nest?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both, apparently,&#8221; he replied, unwillingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t she rocking herself on a bough,
and keeping her nails nice, and fixing her
feathers in the latest style, or perhaps going
off to some fool bird club while he builds the
nest by himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor anybody else,&#8221; she continued, with
much satisfaction. &#8220;Now, if she happened
to have two hundred and twelve feathers, of
the proper size and shape to go into that nest,
do you suppose he&#8217;d refuse to touch them,
and make her cry because she brought them
to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; admitted Harlan.</p>
<p>There was a long silence, then Dorothy
edged up closer to him. &#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221;
she queried, &#8220;that Mr. Robin thinks more of
his wife than you do of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed he doesn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And still, he&#8217;s letting her help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, listen, Harlan. We&#8217;ve got a house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
with more than enough furniture to make it
comfortable, though it&#8217;s not the kind of furniture
either of us particularly like. Instead of
buying a typewriter, we&#8217;ll rent one for three
or four dollars a month until we have enough
money to buy one. And I&#8217;m going to have
a cow and some chickens and a garden, and
I&#8217;m going to sell milk and butter and cream
and fresh eggs and vegetables and chickens
and fruit to the sanitarium, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sanitarium people must have plenty
of those things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not the kind I&#8217;m going to raise, nor
put up as I&#8217;m going to put it up, and we&#8217;ll
be raising most of our own living besides.
You can write when you feel like it, and be
helping me when you don&#8217;t feel like it, and
before we know it, we&#8217;ll be rich. Oh, Harlan,
I feel like Eve all alone in the Garden with
Adam!&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospect fired his imagination, for, in
common with most men, a chicken-ranch had
appealed strongly to Harlan ever since he
could remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he began, slowly, in the tone
which was always a signal of surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it be lovely,&#8221; she cried ecstatically,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
&#8220;to have our own bossy cow mooing in the
barn, and our own chickens for Sunday dinner,
and our own milk, and butter, and cream?
And I&#8217;ll drive the vegetable waggon and you
can take the things in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; interrupted Harlan, firmly.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to do that sort of thing,
you&#8217;ll have people to do the work when I
can&#8217;t help you. The idea of my wife driving
a vegetable cart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Dorothy, submissively,
wise enough to let small points settle
themselves and have her own way in things
that really mattered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not forgotten
that I promised to obey you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gratified smile spread over Harlan&#8217;s
smooth, boyish face, and, half-fearfully, she
reached into her sleeve for a handkerchief
which she had hitherto carefully concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not all,&#8221; she smiled. &#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-three dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why,
where did you get that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was in my dresser. There was a false
bottom in one of the small drawers, and I
took it out and found this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in&mdash;&#8221; began Harlan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a present to us from Uncle Ebeneezer,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
she cried, her eyes sparkling and
her face aglow. &#8220;It&#8217;s for a coop and chickens,&#8221;
she continued, executing an intricate
dance step. &#8220;Oh, Harlan, aren&#8217;t you awfully
glad we came?&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing her pleasure he could not help being
glad, but afterward, when he was alone,
he began to wonder whether they had not
inadvertently moved into a bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be worse places,&#8221; he reflected,
&#8220;for the poor and deserving to move into.
Diamonds and money&mdash;what next?&#8221;</p>

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>Mrs. Smithers</h3>
</div>

<p>The chickens were clucking peacefully in
their corner of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s dooryard,
and the newly acquired bossy cow
mooed unhappily in her improvised stable.
Harlan had christened the cow &#8220;Maud&#8221; because
she insisted upon going into the garden,
and though Dorothy had vigorously protested
against putting Tennyson to such
base uses, the name still held, out of sheer
appropriateness.</p>
<p>Harlan was engaged in that pleasant pastime
known as &#8220;pottering.&#8221; The instinct to
drive nails, put up shelves, and to improve
generally his local habitation is as firmly
seated in the masculine nature as housewifely
characteristics are ingrained in the feminine
soul. Never before having had a home of his
own, Harlan was enjoying it to the full.</p>
<p>Early hours had been the rule at the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
ever since the feathered sultan
with his tribe of voluble wives had taken
up his abode on the hilltop. Indeed, as
Harlan said, they were obliged to sleep
when the chickens did&mdash;if they slept at all.
So it was not yet seven one morning when
Dorothy went in from the chicken coop, singing
softly to herself, and intent upon the particular
hammer her husband wanted, never
expecting to find Her in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I beg your pardon?&#8221; she stammered,
inquiringly.</p>
<p>A gaunt, aged, and preternaturally solemn
female, swathed in crape, bent slightly forward
in her chair, without making an effort
to rise, and reached forth a black-gloved hand
tightly grasping a letter, which was tremulously
addressed to &#8220;Mrs. J. H. Carr.&#8221;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;My dear Madam,&#8221; Dorothy read.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multitudinous duties in connection
with the practice of my profession have unfortunately
prevented me, until the present
hour, from interviewing Mrs. Sarah Smithers
in regard to your requirements. While she is
naturally unwilling to commit herself entirely
without a more definite idea of what is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
expected of her, she is none the less kindly
disposed. May I hope, my dear madam, that
at the first opportunity you will apprise me of
ensuing events in this connection, and that in
any event I may still faithfully serve you?</p>
<p>&#8220;With kindest personal remembrances and
my polite salutations to the distinguished
author whose wife you have the honour to
be, I am, my dear madam,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yr. most respectful and obedient servant,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Jeremiah Bradford</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;you&#8217;re Sarah. I
had almost given you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Begging your parding, Miss,&#8221; rejoined
Mrs. Smithers in a chilly tone of reproof, &#8220;but
I take it it&#8217;s better for us to begin callin&#8217; each
other by our proper names. If we should get
friendly, there&#8217;d be ample time to change.
Your uncle, God rest &#8217;is soul, allers called me
&#8216;Mis&#8217; Smithers.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhat startled at first, Mrs. Carr quickly
recovered her equanimity. &#8220;Very well, Mrs.
Smithers,&#8221; she returned, lightly, reflecting
that when in Rome one must follow Roman
customs; &#8220;Do you understand all branches
of general housework?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t be makin&#8217; no attempts
in that direction,&#8221; replied Mrs. Smithers,
harshly. &#8220;I doesn&#8217;t allow nobody to do
wot I does no better than wot I does it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy smiled, for this was distinctly encouraging,
from at least one point of view.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wear a cap, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mum, for dustin&#8217;. When I goes
out I puts on my bonnet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do plain cooking?&#8221; inquired
Dorothy, hastily, perceiving that she was
treading upon dangerous ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mum. The more plain it is the
better all around. Your uncle was never
one to fill hisself with fancy dishes days and
walk the floor with &#8217;em nights, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e
wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What wages do you have, Sa&mdash;Mrs.
Smithers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked for your uncle for a dollar and
a half a week, bein&#8217; as we&#8217;d knowed each
other so long, and on account of &#8217;im bein&#8217;
easy to get along with and never makin&#8217; no
trouble, but I wouldn&#8217;t work for no woman
for less &#8217;n two dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is satisfactory to me,&#8221; returned
Dorothy, trying to be dignified. &#8220;I daresay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
we shall get on all right. Can you stay
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve finished,&#8221; said Mrs. Smithers,
ignoring the question, &#8220;there&#8217;s a few things
I&#8217;d like to ask. &#8217;Ow did you get that bruise
on your face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I ran into something,&#8221; answered Dorothy,
unwillingly, and taken quite by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot was it,&#8221; demanded Mrs. Smithers.
&#8220;Your &#8217;usband&#8217;s fist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Mrs. Carr, sternly, &#8220;it was a
piece of furniture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never knowed furniture,&#8221; observed
Mrs. Smithers, doubtfully, &#8220;to get up and &#8217;it
people in the face wot wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; nothink
to it. If you disturb a rockin&#8217;-chair at night
w&#8217;en it&#8217;s restin&#8217; quiet, you&#8217;ll get your ankle
&#8217;it, but I&#8217;ve never knowed no furniture to &#8217;it
people under the eye unless it &#8217;ad been threw,
that&#8217;s wot I ain&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mind me of my youngest sister,&#8221; Mrs.
Smithers went on, her keen eyes uncomfortably
fixed upon Dorothy. &#8220;&#8217;Er &#8217;usband was
one of these &#8217;ere masterful men, &#8217;e was, same
as wot yours is, and w&#8217;en &#8217;er didn&#8217;t please
&#8217;im, &#8217;e &#8217;d &#8217;it &#8217;er somethink orful. Many&#8217;s the
time I&#8217;ve gone there and found &#8217;er with &#8217;er
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
poor face all cut up and the crockery broke
bad. &#8216;I dropped a cup&#8217; &#8217;er&#8217;d say to me,
&#8216;and the pieces flew up and &#8217;it me in the
face.&#8217; &#8217;Er face looked like a crazy quilt from
&#8217;aving dropped so many cups, and wunst,
without thinkin&#8217; wot I might be doin&#8217; of, I gave
&#8217;er a chiny tea set for &#8217;er Christmas present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wen I went to see &#8217;er again, the tea set
was all broke and &#8217;er &#8217;ad court plaster all over
&#8217;er face. The pieces must &#8217;ave flew more &#8217;n
common from the tea set, cause &#8217;er &#8217;usband&#8217;s
&#8217;ed was laid open somethink frightful and
they&#8217;d &#8217;ad in the doctor to take a seam in it.
From that time on I never &#8217;eard of no more
cups bein&#8217; dropped and &#8217;er face looked quite
human and peaceful like w&#8217;en &#8217;e died. God
rest &#8217;is soul, &#8217;e ain&#8217;t a-breakin&#8217; no tea sets now
by accident nor a-purpose neither. I was
never one to interfere between man and wife,
Miss Carr, but I want you to tell your &#8217;usband
that should &#8217;e undertake to &#8217;it me, &#8217;e&#8217;ll get a
bucket of &#8217;ot tea throwed in &#8217;is face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not at all likely,&#8221; answered Dorothy,
biting her lip, &#8220;that such a thing will happen.&#8221;
She was swayed by two contradictory
impulses&mdash;one to scream with laughter,
the other to throw something at Mrs. Smithers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s been at peace now six months come
Tuesday,&#8221; continued Mrs. Smithers, &#8220;and on
account of &#8217;is &#8217;avin&#8217; broke the tea set, I don&#8217;t
feel no call to wear mourning for &#8217;im more &#8217;n a
year, though folks thinks as &#8217;ow it brands me
as &#8217;eartless for takin&#8217; it off inside of two.
Sakes alive, wot&#8217;s that?&#8221; she cried, drawing
her sable skirts more closely about her as a
dark shadow darted across the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the cat,&#8221; answered Dorothy, reassuringly.
&#8220;Come here, Claudius.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers repressed an exclamation
of horror as Claudius, purring pleasantly,
came out into the sunlight, brandishing his
plumed tail, and sat down on the edge of
Dorothy&#8217;s skirt, blinking his green eyes at the
intruder.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E&#8217;s the very cat,&#8221; said Mrs. Smithers,
hoarsely, &#8220;wot your uncle killed the week
afore &#8217;e died!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before who died?&#8221; asked Dorothy, a chill
creeping into her blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle,&#8221; whispered Mrs. Smithers,
her eyes still fixed upon Claudius Tiberius.
&#8220;&#8217;E killed that very cat, &#8217;e did, &#8217;cause &#8217;e
couldn&#8217;t never abide &#8217;im, and now &#8217;e&#8217;s come
back!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; cried Dorothy, trying to be
severe. &#8220;If he killed the cat, it couldn&#8217;t
come back&mdash;you must know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know w&#8217;y not, Miss. Anyhow, &#8217;e
killed the cat, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e did, and I saw &#8217;is
dead body, and even buried &#8217;im, on account
of your uncle not bein&#8217; able to abide cats,
and &#8217;ere &#8217;e is. Somebody &#8217;s dug &#8217;im up,
and &#8217;e &#8217;s come to life again, thinkin&#8217; to &#8217;aunt
your uncle, and your uncle &#8217;as follered &#8217;im,
that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e &#8217;as, and there bein&#8217; nobody &#8217;ere
to &#8217;aunt but us, &#8217;e&#8217;s a &#8217;auntin&#8217; us and a-doin&#8217;
it &#8217;ard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Smithers,&#8221; said Dorothy, rising, &#8220;I
desire to hear no more of this nonsense. The
cat happens to be somewhat similar to the
dead one, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Begging your parding, Miss, for askin&#8217;,
but did you bring that there cat with you from
the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>Affecting not to hear, Dorothy went out,
followed by Claudius Tiberius, who appeared
anything but ghostly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; muttered Mrs. Smithers,
gloomily, to herself. &#8220;&#8217;E was &#8217;ere w&#8217;en &#8217;er
come, and &#8217;e&#8217;s the same cat. &#8217;E&#8217;s come back
to &#8217;aunt us, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e &#8217;as!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan,&#8221; said Dorothy, half-way between
smiles and tears, &#8220;she&#8217;s come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan dropped his saw and took up his
hammer. &#8220;Who&#8217;s come?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;From
your tone, it might be Mrs. Satan, or somebody
else from the infernal regions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not far out of the way,&#8221; rejoined
Dorothy. &#8220;It&#8217;s Sa&mdash;Mrs. Smithers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, our maid of all work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s made of,&#8221; giggled
Dorothy, hysterically. &#8220;She looks like
a tombstone dressed in deep mourning, and
carries with her the atmosphere of a graveyard.
We have to call her &#8216;Mrs. Smithers,&#8217;
if we don&#8217;t want her to call us by our first
names, and she has two dollars a week. She
says Claudius is a cat that uncle killed the
week before he died, and she thinks you hit
me and gave me this bruise on my cheek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old lizard,&#8221; said Harlan, indignantly.
&#8220;She sha&#8217;n&#8217;t stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t be cross,&#8221; interrupted Dorothy.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all in the family, for your uncle
hit me, as you well know. Besides, we
can&#8217;t expect all the virtues for two dollars a
week and I&#8217;m tired almost to death from trying
to do the housework in this big house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
and take care of the chickens, too. We&#8217;ll
get on with her as best we can until we see a
chance to do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wise little woman,&#8221; responded Harlan,
admiringly. &#8220;Can she milk the cow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;ll go in and ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Miss,&#8221; began Mrs. Smithers,
before Dorothy had a chance to speak, &#8220;but
am I to &#8217;ave my old rooms?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which rooms were they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These &#8217;ere, back of the kitchen. My
own settin&#8217; room and bedroom and kitchen
and pantry and my own private door outside.
Your uncle was allers a great hand for bein&#8217;
private and insistin&#8217; on other folks keepin&#8217;
private, that &#8217;s wot &#8217;e was, but God rest &#8217;is
soul, it didn&#8217;t do the poor old gent much
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;take your old
rooms. And can you milk a cow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers sighed. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t never &#8217;ad it
put on me, Miss,&#8221; she said, with the air of a
martyr trying to make himself comfortable
up against the stake, &#8220;not as a regler thing, I
ain&#8217;t, but wotever I&#8217;m asked to do in the line
of duty whiles I&#8217;m dwellin&#8217; in this sufferin&#8217;
and dyin&#8217; world, I aims to do the best wot I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
can, w&#8217;ether it&#8217;s milkin&#8217; a cow, drownin&#8217; kittens,
or buryin&#8217; a cat wot can&#8217;t stay buried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have breakfast about half-past seven,&#8221;
went on Dorothy, quickly; &#8220;luncheon at
noon and dinner at six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot at six?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Smithers,
pricking up her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner! Dinner at six.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord preserve us,&#8221; said Mrs. Smithers,
half to herself. &#8220;Your uncle allers &#8217;ad &#8217;is
dinner at one o&#8217;clock, sharp, and &#8217;e wouldn&#8217;t
like it to &#8217;ave such scandalous goin&#8217;s on in &#8217;is
own &#8217;ouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re working for me,&#8221; Dorothy reminded
her sharply, &#8220;and not for my uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, during which
Mrs. Smithers peered curiously at her young
mistress over her steel-bowed spectacles.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure as you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;On
account of the cat &#8217;avin come back from &#8217;is
grave, it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me none to see
your uncle settin&#8217; &#8217;ere at any time in &#8217;is
shroud, and a-askin&#8217; to &#8217;ave mush and milk
for &#8217;is supper, the which &#8217;e was so powerful
fond of that I was more &#8217;n &#8217;alf minded at the
last minute to put some of it in &#8217;s coffin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Smithers,&#8221; said Dorothy, severely,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
&#8220;I do not want to hear any more about dead
people, or resurrected cats, or anything of
that nature. What&#8217;s gone is gone, and
there&#8217;s no use in continually referring to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this significant moment, Claudius Tiberius
paraded somewhat ostentatiously
through the kitchen and went outdoors.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Miss?&#8221; asked Mrs. Smithers,
with ill-concealed satisfaction. &#8220;Wot&#8217;s gone
ain&#8217;t always gone for long, that&#8217;s wot it
ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy retreated, followed by a sepulchral
laugh which grated on her nerves.
&#8220;Upon my word, dear,&#8221; she said to Harlan,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;re going to stand
having that woman in the house. She makes
me feel as if I were an undertaker, a grave
digger, and a cemetery, all rolled into one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too imaginative,&#8221; said Harlan,
tenderly, stroking her soft cheek. He had
not yet seen Mrs. Smithers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; Dorothy admitted, &#8220;when she
gets that pyramid of crape off her head, she&#8217;ll
seem more nearly human. Do you suppose
she expects to wear it in the house all the
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carr!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>The gaunt black shadow appeared in the
doorway of the kitchen and the high, harsh
voice shrilled imperiously across the yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming,&#8221; answered Dorothy, submissively,
for in the tone there was that which
instinctively impels obedience. &#8220;What is
it?&#8221; she asked, when she entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothink. I only wants to know wot it is
you&#8217;re layin&#8217; out to &#8217;ave for your&mdash;luncheon,
if that&#8217;s wot you call it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poached eggs on toast, last night&#8217;s cold
potatoes warmed over, hot biscuits, jam, and
tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s articulate response resembled
a cluck more closely than anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can make biscuits, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;
went on Dorothy, hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;ave,&#8221; responded Mrs. Smithers, dryly.
&#8220;Begging your parding, Miss, but is that
there feller sawin&#8217; wood out by the chicken
coop your &#8217;usband?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The gentleman in the yard,&#8221; said Dorothy,
icily, &#8220;is Mr. Carr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be n&#8217;t you married to &#8217;im?&#8221; cried Mrs.
Smithers, dropping a fork. &#8220;I understood as
&#8217;ow you was, else I wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;ave come. I
was never one to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I most assuredly <i>am</i> married to him,&#8221;
answered Dorothy, with due emphasis on the
verb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! &#8217;E&#8217;s the build of my youngest
sister&#8217;s poor dead &#8217;usband; the one wot broke
the tea set wot I give &#8217;er over &#8217;er poor &#8217;ed.
&#8217;E can &#8217;it powerful &#8217;ard, can&#8217;t &#8217;e?&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite beyond speech, Dorothy went outdoors
again, her head held high and a dangerous
light in her eyes. To-morrow, or next
week at the latest, should witness the forced
departure of Mrs. Smithers. Mrs. Carr realised
that the woman did not intend to be impertinent,
and that the social forms of Judson
Centre were not those of New York. Still,
some things were unbearable.</p>
<p>The luncheon that was set before them,
however, went far toward atonement. With
the best intentions in the world, Dorothy&#8217;s
cooking nearly always went wide of the mark,
and Harlan welcomed the change with unmistakable
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Dorothy,&#8221; he whispered, as they
rose from the table; &#8220;get on with her if you
can. Anybody who can make such biscuits
as these will go out of the house only over
my dead body.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>The latter part of the speech was unfortunate.
&#8220;My surroundings are so extremely
cheerful,&#8221; remarked Dorothy, &#8220;that I&#8217;ve decided
to spend the afternoon in the library
reading Poe. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do it
and I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll ever feel any creepier
than I do this blessed minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of his laughing protest, she went
into the library, locked the door, and curled
up in Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s easy chair with a
well-thumbed volume of Poe, finding a two-dollar
bill used in one place as a book mark.
She read for some time, then took down another
book, which opened of itself at &#8220;The
Gold Bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pages were thickly strewn with marginal
comments in the fine, small, shaky hand
she had learned to associate with Uncle Ebeneezer.
The paragraph about the skull, in the
tree above the treasure, had evidently filled
the last reader with unprecedented admiration,
for on the margin was written twice, in ink:
&#8220;A very, very pretty idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed aloud, for her thoughts since
morning had been persistently directed toward
things not of this world. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m
not superstitious,&#8221; she thought, then jumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
almost out of her chair at the sound of an
ominous crash in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; she thought, settling back
into her place. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let that old monument
alone just as much as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon the whole, it was just as well, for
the &#8220;old monument&#8221; was on her bony knees,
with her head and shoulders quite lost in
the secret depths of the kitchen range. &#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; she was muttering, &#8220;where &#8217;e could
&#8217;ave put it. It would &#8217;ave been just like
that old skinflint to &#8217;ave &#8217;id it in the stove!&#8221;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>The Coming of Elaine</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no state of mental wretchedness
akin to that which precedes the writing
of a book. Harlan was moody and despairing,
chiefly because he could not understand what
it all meant. Something hung over him like a
black cloud, completely obscuring his usual
sunny cheerfulness.</p>
<p>He burned with the desire to achieve, yet
from the depths of his soul came only emptiness.
Vague, purposeless aspirations, like disembodied
spirits, haunted him by night and by
day. Before his inner vision came unfamiliar
scenes, detached fragments of conversation,
the atmosphere, the feeling of an old romance,
then, by a swift change, darkness from which
there seemed no possible escape.</p>
<p>A woman with golden hair, mounted upon
a white horse, gay with scarlet and silver trappings&mdash;surely
her name was Elaine? And the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
company of gallant knights who followed her
as she set forth upon her quest&mdash;who were
they, and from whence did they hail? The
fool of the court, with his bauble and his
cracked, meaningless laughter, danced in and
out of the picture with impish glee. Behind
it all was the sunset, such a sunset as was
never seen on land or sea. Ribbons of splendid
colour streamed from the horizon to the
zenith and set the shields of the knights aglow
with shimmering flame. Clashing cymbals
sounded from afar, then, clear and high, a
bugle call, the winding silvery notes growing
fainter and fainter till they were lost in the
purple silence of the hills. Elaine turned, smiling&mdash;was
not her name Elaine? And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Darkness fell and the picture was utterly
wiped out. Harlan turned away with a sigh.</p>
<p>To take the dead, dry bones of words, the
tiny black things that march in set spaces
across the page; to set each where it inevitably
belongs&mdash;truly, it seems simple enough.
But from the vast range of our written speech
to select those which fittingly clothe the
thought is quite another matter, and presupposes
the thought. Even then, by necessity,
the outcome is uncertain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>Within the mind of the writer, the Book
lives and breathes; a child of the brain, yearning
for birth. At a white heat, after long
waiting, the words come&mdash;merely a commentary,
an index, a marginal note of that within.
Reading afterward the written words, the fine
invisible links, the colour and the music, are
treacherously supplied by the imagination,
which is at once the best friend and the
worst enemy. How is one to know that
only a small part of it has been written, that
the best of it, far past writing, lingers still
unborn?</p>
<p>Long afterward, when the original picture
has faded as though it had never been, one
may read his printed work, and wonder, in
abject self-abasement, by what miracle it was
ever printed. He has trusted to some unknown
psychology which strongly savours of
the Black Art to reproduce in the minds of his
readers the picture which was in his, and from
which these fragmentary, marginal notes were
traced. Only the words, the dead, meaningless
words, stripped of all the fancy which
once made them fair, to make for the thousands
the wild, delirious bliss that the writer knew!
To write with the tears falling upon the page,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and afterward to read, in some particularly
poignant and searching review, that &#8220;the
book fails to convince!&#8221; Happy is he whose
written pages reproduce but faintly the glow
from whence they came. For &#8220;whoso with
blood and tears would dig Art out of his soul,
may lavish his golden prime in pursuit of
emptiness, or, striking treasure, find only
fairy gold, so that when his eyes are purged
of the spell of morning, he sees his hands are
full of withered leaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>A meadow-lark, rising from a distant field,
dropped golden notes into the still, sunlit
air, then vanished into the blue spaces beyond.
A bough of apple bloom, its starry
petals anchored only by invisible cobwebs,
softly shook white fragrance into the grass.
Then, like a vision straight from the golden
city with the walls of pearl, came Elaine, the
beautiful, her blue eyes laughing, and her
scarlet lips parted in a smile.</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s heart sang within him. His trembling
hands grasped feverishly at the sheaf of
copy-paper which had waited for this, week
in and week out. The pencil was ready to
his hand, and the words fairly wrote themselves:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p><i>It came to pass that when the year was at
the Spring, the Lady Elaine fared forth upon
the Heart&#8217;s Quest. She was mounted upon a
snowy palfrey, whose trappings of scarlet and
silver gleamed brightly in the sun. Her gown
was of white satin, wondrously embroidered in
fine gold thread, which was no less gold than
her hair, falling in unchecked splendour about
her.</i></p>
<p><i>Blue as sapphires were the eyes of Elaine,
and her fair cheek was like that of an apple-blossom.
Set like a rose upon pearl was the
dewy, fragrant sweetness of her mouth, and
her breath was like that of the rose itself. Her
hands&mdash;but how shall I write of the flower-like
hands of Elaine? They&mdash;</i></p>
<p>The door-bell pealed portentously through
the house, echoing and re-echoing through the
empty rooms. No answer. Presently it rang
again, insistently, and Elaine, with her snowy
palfrey, whisked suddenly out of sight.</p>
<p>Gone, except for these few lines! Harlan
stifled a groan and the bell rang once more.</p>
<p>Heavens! Where was Dorothy? Where
was Mrs. Smithers? Was there no one in the
house but himself? Apparently not, for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
bell rang determinedly, and with military
precision.</p>
<p>&#8220;March, march, forward march!&#8221; grumbled
Harlan, as he ran downstairs, the one-two,
one-two-three being registered meanwhile on
the bell-wire.</p>
<p>It was not a pleasant person who violently
wrenched the door open, but in spite of his
annoyance, Harlan could not be discourteous
to a lady. She was tall, and slender, and pale,
with blue eyes and yellow hair, and so very
fragile that it seemed as though a passing
zephyr might almost blow her away.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do,&#8221; she said, wearily. &#8220;I
thought you were never coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was busy,&#8221; said Harlan, in extenuation.
&#8220;Will you come in?&#8221; She was evidently a
friend of Dorothy&#8217;s, and, as such, demanded
proper consideration.</p>
<p>The invitation was needless, however, for
even as he spoke, she brushed past him, and
went into the parlour. &#8220;I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; she
breathed. &#8220;I walked up that long hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have done it,&#8221; returned
Harlan, standing first on one foot and then on
the other. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you find the stage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t look for it. I never had any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
ambition to go on the stage,&#8221; she concluded,
with a faint smile. &#8220;Where is Uncle
Ebeneezer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No friend of Dorothy&#8217;s,&#8221; thought Harlan,
shifting to the other foot. &#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer,&#8221;
he said, clearing his throat, &#8220;is at
peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded the
girl, sinking into one of the haircloth chairs.
&#8220;Where is Uncle Ebeneezer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer is dead,&#8221; explained Harlan,
somewhat tartly. Then, as he remembered
the utter ruin of his work, he added,
viciously, &#8220;never having known him intimately,
I can&#8217;t say just where he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned back in her chair, her face as
white as death. Harlan thought she had
fainted, when she relieved his mind by bursting
into tears. He was more familiar with
salt water, but, none the less, the situation
was awkward.</p>
<p>There were no signs of Dorothy, so Harlan,
in an effort to be consoling, took the visitor&#8217;s
cold hands in his. &#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; he said, kindly;
&#8220;cheer up. You are among friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no friends,&#8221; she answered, between
sobs. &#8220;I lost the last when my dear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
mother died. She made me promise, during
her last illness, that if anything happened to
her, I would come to Uncle Ebeneezer. She
said she had never imposed upon him and that
he would gladly take care of me, for her sake.
I was ill a long, long time, but as soon as I was
able to, I came, and now&mdash;and now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Harlan, again, awkwardly
patting her hands, and deeply touched by the
girl&#8217;s distress. &#8220;We are your friends. You
can stay here just as well as not. I am married
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon his back, Harlan felt eyes. He turned
quickly, and saw Dorothy standing in the
door&mdash;quite a new Dorothy, indeed; very
tall, and stately, and pale.</p>
<p>Through sheer nervousness, Mr. Carr
laughed&mdash;an unfortunate, high-pitched laugh
with no mirth in it. &#8220;Let me present my
wife,&#8221; he said, sobering suddenly. &#8220;Mrs.
Carr, Miss&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here he coughed, and the guest, rising,
filled the pause. &#8220;I am Elaine St. Clair,&#8221; she
explained, offering a white, tremulous hand
which Dorothy did not seem to see. &#8220;It is
very good of your husband to ask me to stay
with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; replied Dorothy, in a tone altogether
new to her husband. &#8220;He is always
doing lovely things for people. And now,
Harlan, if you will show Miss St. Clair to her
room, I will speak with Mrs. Smithers about
luncheon, which should be nearly ready by
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thunder,&#8221; said Harlan to himself, as
Dorothy withdrew. &#8220;What in the devil do
I know about &#8217;her room&#8217;? Have you ever
been here before?&#8221; he inquired of the guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never in my life,&#8221; answered Miss St.
Clair, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; replied Harlan, confusedly, &#8220;just
go on upstairs, then, and help yourself. There
are plenty of rooms, and cribs to burn in every
blamed one of &#8217;em,&#8221; he added, savagely, remembering
the look in Dorothy&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Miss St. Clair, diffidently;
&#8220;it is very kind of you to let me
choose. Can some one bring my trunk up
this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to it,&#8221; replied her host,
brusquely.</p>
<p>She trailed noiselessly upstairs, carrying her
heavy suit case, and Harlan, not altogether
happy at the prospect, went in search of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Dorothy. At the kitchen door he paused,
hearing voices within.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve usually et by themselves,&#8221; Mrs.
Smithers was saying. &#8220;Is this a new one,
or a friend of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence was utterly without meaning,
either to Harlan or Dorothy, but the answer
was given, as quick as a flash. &#8220;A friend,
Mrs. Smithers&mdash;a very dear old friend of Mr.
Carr&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Carr&#8217;s,&#8217;&#8221; repeated Harlan, miserably,
tiptoeing away to the library, where he
sat down and wiped his forehead. &#8220;&#8216;A very
dear old friend.&#8217;&#8221; Disconnectedly, and with
pronounced emphasis, Harlan mentioned the
place which is said to be paved with good
intentions.</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve, and it was just
eleven when he had begun on <i>The Quest of
the Lady Elaine</i>. &#8220;&#8216;One crowded hour of
glorious life is worth&#8217;&mdash;what idiot said it was
worth anything?&#8221; groaned Harlan, inwardly.
&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;ve had the crowded hour. &#8216;Better
fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;the
line sang itself into his consciousness.
&#8220;Europe be everlastingly condemned,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Oh, how my head aches!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, wondering
where &#8220;Cathay&#8221; might be. It sounded like
a nice, quiet place, with no &#8220;dear old friends&#8221;
in it&mdash;a peaceful spot where people could
write books if they wanted to. &#8220;Just why,&#8221;
he asked himself more than once, &#8220;was I inspired
to grab the shaky paw of that human
sponge? &#8216;Tears, idle tears, I know not
what they mean&#8217;&mdash;oh, the devil! She must
have a volume of Tennyson in her grip, and
it&#8217;s soaking through!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers came out into the hall, more
sepulchral and grim-visaged than ever, and
rang the bell for luncheon. To Harlan&#8217;s fevered
fancy, it sounded like a sexton tolling a
bell for a funeral. Miss St. Clair, with the
traces of tears practically removed, floated
gracefully downstairs, and Harlan, coming
out of the library with the furtive step of a
wild beast from its lair, met her inopportunely
at the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>She smiled at him in a timid, but friendly
fashion, and at the precise moment, Dorothy
appeared in the dining-room door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harlan, dear,&#8221; she said, in her sweetest
tones, &#8220;will you give our guest your arm and escort
her out to luncheon? I have it all ready!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>Miss St. Clair clutched timidly at Harlan&#8217;s
rigid coat sleeve, wondering what strange
custom of the house would be evident next,
and the fog was thick before Mr. Carr&#8217;s eyes,
when he took his accustomed seat at the head
of the table. As a sign of devotion, he tried
to step on Dorothy&#8217;s foot under the table,
after a pleasing habit of their courtship in the
New York boarding-house, but he succeeded
only in drawing an unconscious &#8220;ouch&#8221; and
a vivid blush from Miss St. Clair, by which he
impressed Dorothy more deeply than he
could have hoped to do otherwise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you come far, Miss St. Clair?&#8221;
asked Dorothy, conventionally.</p>
<p>&#8220;From New York,&#8221; answered the guest,
taking a plate of fried chicken from Harlan&#8217;s
shaky hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Dorothy sweetly. &#8220;We
come from New York, too.&#8221; Then she took
a bold, daring plunge. &#8220;I have often heard
my husband speak of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of me, Mrs. Carr? Surely not! It must
have been some other Elaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; smiled Dorothy, shrugging her
shoulders. &#8220;No doubt I am mistaken, but
you may have heard of me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Elaine assured her.
&#8220;I never heard of you in my life before.
Why should I?&#8221; A sudden and earnest
crow under the window behind her startled
her so that she dropped her knife. Harlan
stooped for it at the same time she did and
their heads bumped together smartly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gentleman chicken,&#8221; went on Dorothy,
tactfully. &#8220;We call him &#8216;Abdul Hamid.&#8217;
You know the masculine nature is instinctively
polygamous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan cackled mirthlessly, wondering, subconsciously,
how Abdul Hamid could have
escaped from the coop. After that there was
silence, save as Dorothy, in her most hospitable
manner, occasionally urged the guest to
have more of something. Throughout luncheon,
she never once spoke to Harlan, nor
took so much as a single glance at his red,
unhappy face. Even his ears were scarlet,
and the delicious fried chicken which he was
eating might have been a section of rag
carpet, for all he knew to the contrary.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Miss St. Clair,&#8221; said Dorothy,
kindly, as they rose from the table, &#8220;I am sure
you will wish to lie down and rest after your
long journey. Which room did you choose?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at all of them,&#8221; responded Elaine,
touched to the heart by this unexpected kindness
from strangers, &#8220;and finally chose the
suite in the south wing. It&#8217;s a nice large
room, with such a darling little sitting-room
attached, and such a dear work basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan nearly burst, for the description was
of Dorothy&#8217;s own particular sanctum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Carr, very quietly; &#8220;I
thought my husband would choose that room
for you&mdash;dear Harlan is always so thoughtful!
I will go up with you and take out a few of
my things which have been unfortunately left
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Mr. Carr also climbed the
stairs, his head swimming and his knees
knocking together. Nervously, he turned
over the few pages of his manuscript, then,
hearing Dorothy coming, grabbed it and fled
like a thief to the library on the first floor.
In his panic he bolted the doors and windows
of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s former retreat. It was
unnecessary, however, for no one came near
him.</p>
<p>Throughout the long, sweet Spring afternoon,
Miss St. Clair slept the dreamless sleep
of utter exhaustion, Harlan worked fruitlessly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
at <i>The Quest of Lady Elaine</i>, and Dorothy
busied herself about her household tasks,
singing with forced cheerfulness whenever
she was within hearing of the library.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain&#8221; thought Harlan, wretchedly.
But after all what was there to explain,
except that he had never seen Miss St. Clair
before, never in all his life heard of her,
never knew there was such a person, or had
never met anybody who knew anything about
her? &#8220;Besides,&#8221; he continued to himself
&#8220;even then, what excuse have I got for stroking
a strange woman&#8217;s hand and telling her
I&#8217;m married?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, he decided that
it would be policy to ignore the whole matter.
It was an unfortunate misunderstanding all
around, which could not be cleared away by
speech, unless Dorothy should ask him about
it&mdash;which he was very certain she would not
do. &#8220;She ought to trust me,&#8221; he said to
himself, resentfully, forgetting the absolute
openness of thought and deed upon which a
woman&#8217;s trust is founded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll read her the
book to-night,&#8221; he thought, happily, &#8220;and
that will please her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was fated not to. After dinner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
which was much the same as luncheon, as
far as conversation was concerned, Harlan invited
Dorothy to come into the library.</p>
<p>She followed him, obediently enough, and
he closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; he began, with a grin which
was meant to be cheerful and was merely
ridiculous, &#8220;I&#8217;ve begun the book&mdash;I actually
have! I&#8217;ve been working on it all day. Just
listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurriedly possessing himself of the manuscript,
he read it in an unnatural voice, down
to the flower-like hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can say that, Harlan,&#8221;
interrupted Dorothy, coolly critical; &#8220;I particularly
noticed her hands and they&#8217;re not
nice at all. They&#8217;re red and rough and nearly
the size of a policeman&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose hands?&#8221; demanded Harlan, in
genuine astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Elaine&#8217;s&mdash;Miss St. Clair&#8217;s. If you&#8217;re
going to do a book about her, you might at
least try to make it truthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr went out, closing the door carefully,
but firmly. Then, for the first time, the
whole wretched situation dawned upon the
young and aspiring author.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>An Uninvited Guest</h3>
</div>

<p>Dorothy sat alone in her room, facing
the first heartache of her married life.
She repeatedly told herself that she was not
jealous; that the primitive, unlovely emotion
was far beneath such as she. But if Harlan
had only told her, instead of leaving her to
find out in this miserable way! It had never
entered her head that the clear-eyed, clean-minded
boy whom she had married, could
have anything even remotely resembling a
past, and here it was in her own house!
Moreover, it had inspired a book, and she
herself had been unable to get him to work
at all.</p>
<p>Just why women should be concerned in regard
to old loves has never been wholly clear.
One might as well fancy a clean slate, freshly
and elaborately dedicated to noble composition,
being bothered by the addition and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
subtraction which was once done upon its
surface.</p>
<p>With her own eyes she had seen Miss St.
Clair weeping, while Harlan held her hands
and explained that he was married. Undoubtedly
Miss St. Clair accounted for various
metropolitan delays and absences which she
had joyously forgiven on the score of Harlan&#8217;s
&#8220;work.&#8221; Bitterest of all was the thought
that she must endure it&mdash;that the long years
ahead of her offered no escape, no remedy,
except the ignoble, painful one which she
would not for a moment consider.</p>
<p>A sudden flash of resentment stiffened her
backbone, metaphorically speaking. In spite
of Miss St. Clair, Harlan had married her, and
it was Miss St. Clair who was weeping over
the event, not Harlan. She had seen that the
visitor made Harlan unhappy&mdash;very well, she
would generously throw them together and
make him painfully weary of her, for Love&#8217;s
certain destroyer is Satiety. Deep in Dorothy&#8217;s
consciousness was the abiding satisfaction that
she had never once, as she put it to herself,
&#8220;chased him.&#8221; Never a note, never a telephone
call, never a question as to his coming
and going appeared now to trouble her. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
ancient, primeval relation of the Seeker and
the Sought had not for a single moment been
altered through her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elaine had settled down peacefully
enough. Having been regaled since
infancy with tales of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s generous
hospitality, it seemed only fitting and
proper that his relatives should make her welcome,
even though Elaine&#8217;s mother had been
only a second cousin of Mrs. Judson&#8217;s. Elaine
had been deeply touched by Harlan&#8217;s solicitude
and Dorothy&#8217;s kindness, seeing in it
nothing more than the manifestation of a
beautiful spirit toward one who was helpless
and ill.</p>
<p>A modest wardrobe and a few hundred
dollars, saved from the wreck of her mother&#8217;s
estate, and the household furniture in storage,
represented Elaine&#8217;s worldly goods. As too
often happens in a material world, she had
been trained to do nothing but sing a little,
play a little, and paint unspeakably. She
planned, vaguely, to stay where she was during
the Summer, and in the Autumn, when
she had quite recovered her former strength,
to take her money and learn some method of
self-support.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Just now she was resting. A late breakfast,
a walk through the country, a light luncheon,
and a long nap accounted for Elaine&#8217;s day
until dinner-time. After dinner, for an hour,
she exchanged commonplaces with the Carrs,
then retired to her own room with a book
from Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s library. Even Dorothy
was forced to admit that she made very
little trouble.</p>
<p>The train rumbled into the station&mdash;the very
same train which had brought the Serpent
into Paradise. Dorothy smiled a little at the
idea of a snake travelling on a train unless
it belonged to a circus, and wiped her eyes.
Having mapped out her line of conduct, the
rest was simple enough&mdash;to abide by it even
to the smallest details, and patiently await
results.</p>
<p>When she went downstairs again she was
outwardly quite herself, but altogether unprepared
for the surprise that awaited her in the
parlour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; cried a masculine voice, cheerily,
as she entered the room. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen
you before, have I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I know of,&#8221; replied Dorothy,
startled, but not in the least afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>The young man who rose to greet her was
not at all unpleasant to look upon. He was
taller than Harlan, smooth-shaven, had nice
brown eyes, and a mop of curly brown hair
which evidently annoyed him. Moreover, he
was laughing, as much from sheer joy of living
as anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which side of the house are you a relative
of?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inside,&#8221; returned Dorothy. &#8220;I keep
house here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so! What&#8217;s become of
Sally? Uncle shoo her off the lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about,&#8221;
answered Dorothy, with a fruitless effort
to appear matronly and dignified. &#8220;If by
&#8216;uncle&#8217; you mean Uncle Ebeneezer, he&#8217;s
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t tell me! Reaped at last, after
all this delay! Then how did you come
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By train,&#8221; responded Dorothy, enjoying
the situation to the utmost. &#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer
left the house and furniture to my
husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man sank into a chair and
wiped the traces of deep emotion from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
ruddy face. &#8220;Hully Gee!&#8221; he said, when he
recovered speech. &#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s French
for &#8216;Dick, chase yourself.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; suggested Mrs. Carr,
strangely loath to have this breezy individual
take his departure. &#8220;You might tell me who
you are; don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bad notion at all. I&#8217;m the Dick of
the firm of &#8216;Tom, Dick, and Harry,&#8217; you&#8217;ve
doubtless heard about from your childhood.
My other name is Chester, but few know it.
I&#8217;m merely &#8216;Dick&#8217; to everybody, yourself included,
I trust,&#8221; he added with an elaborate
bow. &#8220;If you will sit down, and make
yourself comfortable, I will now unfold to you
the sad story of my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born of poor but honest parents
about twenty-three years ago, according to
the last official census. They brought me up
until I reached the ripe age of twelve, then got
tired of their job and went to heaven. Since
then I&#8217;ve brought myself up. I&#8217;ve just taught
a college all it can learn from me, and been
put out. Prexy confided to me that I wasn&#8217;t
going to graduate, so I shook the classic dust
from my weary feet and fled hither as to a
harbour of refuge. I&#8217;ve always spent my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Summers with Uncle Ebeneezer, because it
was cheap for me and good for him, but I can&#8217;t
undertake to follow him up this Summer, not
knowing exactly where he is, and not caring
for a warm climate anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inexpressibly shocked, Dorothy looked up
to the portrait over the mantel half fearfully,
but there was no change in the stern, malicious
old face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid of him, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked
Dick, with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always have been,&#8221; admitted Dorothy.
&#8220;He scared me the first time we came here&mdash;it
was at night, and raining.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known him to scare people in broad
daylight, and they weren&#8217;t always women
either. He used to be a pleasant old codger,
but he got over it, and after he learned to
swear readily, he was a pretty tough party to
buck up against. It took nerve to stay here
when uncle was in a bad mood, but most
people have more nerve than they think they
have. You haven&#8217;t told me your name yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Carr&mdash;Dorothy Carr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty name,&#8221; remarked Dick, with evident
admiration. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll
call you &#8216;Dorothy&#8217; till the train goes back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
It will be something for me to remember in
the desert waste of my empty years to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>A friendly, hospitable impulse seized Mrs.
Carr. &#8220;Why should you go?&#8221; she inquired,
smiling. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve been in the habit of
spending your Summers here, you needn&#8217;t
change on our account. We&#8217;d be glad to
have you, I&#8217;m sure. A dear old friend of my
husband&#8217;s is already here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine or superfine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Superfine,&#8221; returned Dorothy, feeling very
much as though the clock had been turned
back twenty years or more and she was at a
children&#8217;s party again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bet your sweet life I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221;
said Dick, &#8220;and if I bother you at any time,
just say so and I&#8217;ll skate out, with no hard
feelings on either side. You may need me
when the rest of the bunch gets here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest of&mdash;oh Harlan, come here a
minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had caught him as he was going into
the library with his work, thinking that a
change of environment might possibly produce
an acceptable change in the current of
his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; said Dorothy, when Harlan came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
to the door, &#8220;this is my husband. Mr.
Chester, Mr. Carr.&#8221;</p>
<p>For days Harlan had not seen Dorothy with
such rosy cheeks, such dancing eyes, nor half
as many dimples. Bewildered, and not altogether
pleased, he awkwardly extended his
hand to Mr. Chester, with a conventional
&#8220;how do you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick wrung the offered hand in a mighty
grip which made Harlan wince. &#8220;I congratulate
you, Mr. Carr,&#8221; he said gallantly, &#8220;upon
possessing the fairest ornament of her sex.
Guess this letter is for you, isn&#8217;t it? I found
it in the post-office while the keeper was out,
and just took it. If it doesn&#8217;t belong here,
I&#8217;ll skip back with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; murmured Harlan, rubbing the
injured hand with the other. &#8220;I&mdash;where did
you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The station,&#8221; explained Dick, pleasantly.
&#8220;I never trace myself back of where I was
last seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to stay with us, Harlan,&#8221; put
in Dorothy, wickedly, &#8220;so you mustn&#8217;t let us
keep you away from your work. Come
along, Dick, and I&#8217;ll show you our cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went out, followed by a long, low
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
whistle of astonishment from Harlan which
Dorothy&#8217;s acute ears did not miss. Presently
Mr. Carr retreated into the library, and locked
the door, but he did not work. The book was
at a deadlock, half a paragraph beyond &#8220;the
flower-like hands of Elaine,&#8221; of which, indeed,
the author had confessed his inability to write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick,&#8221; thought Harlan. &#8220;Mr. Chester.
A young giant with a grip like an octopus.
&#8216;The fairest ornament of her sex.&#8217; Never,
never heard of him before. Some old flame
of Dorothy&#8217;s, who has discovered her whereabouts
and brazenly followed her, even on her
honeymoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he, Harlan, was absolutely prevented
from speaking of it by an unhappy chain of
circumstances which put him in a false light!
For the first time he fully perceived how a
single thoughtless action may bind all one&#8217;s
future existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just because I stroked the hand of a distressed
damsel,&#8221; muttered Harlan, &#8220;and told
her I was married, I&#8217;ve got to sit and see a
procession of my wife&#8217;s old lovers marking
time here all Summer!&#8221; In his fevered fancy,
he already saw the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern surrounded
by Mrs. Carr&#8217;s former admirers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
heard them call her &#8220;Dorothy,&#8221; and realised
that there was not a single thing he could do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless, of course,&#8221; he added, mentally,
&#8220;it gets too bad, and I have an excuse to order
&#8217;em out. And then, probably, Dorothy
will tell Elaine to take her dolls and go home,
and the poor thing&#8217;s got nowhere to go&mdash;nowhere
in the wide world.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would Dorothy like to be a lonely
orphan, with no husband, no friends, and no
job? She wouldn&#8217;t like it much, but women
never have any sympathy for each other, nor
for their husbands, either. I&#8217;d give twenty
dollars this minute not to have stroked
Elaine&#8217;s hand, and fifty not to have had
Dorothy see it, but there&#8217;s no use in crying
over spilt milk nor in regretting hands that
have already been stroked.&#8221;</p>
<p>In search of diversion, he opened his letter,
which was in answer to the one he had written
some little time ago, inquiring minutely,
of an acquaintance who was supposed to be
successful, just what the prospects were for a
beginner in the literary craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Carr,&#8221; the letter read. &#8220;Sorry not
to have answered before, but I&#8217;ve been away
and things got mixed up. Wouldn&#8217;t advise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
anybody but an enemy to take up writing as
a steady job, but if you feel the call, go in and
win. You can make all the way from eight
dollars a year, which was what I made when
I first struck out, up to five thousand, which
was what I averaged last year. I&#8217;ve always
envied you fellows who could turn in your
stuff and get paid for it the following Tuesday.
In my line, you work like the devil
this year for what you&#8217;re going to get next,
and live on the year after.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, if you&#8217;re bitten with it, there&#8217;s
no cure. You&#8217;ll see magazine articles in
stones and books in running brooks all the
rest of your life. When you get your book
done, I&#8217;ll trot you around to my publisher,
who enjoys the proud distinction of being an
honest one, and if he likes your stuff, he&#8217;ll
take it, and if he doesn&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll turn you down
so pleasantly that you&#8217;ll feel as though he&#8217;d
made you a present of something. If you
think you&#8217;ve got genius, forget it, and remember
that nothing takes the place of hard
work. And, besides, it&#8217;s a pretty blamed
poor book that can&#8217;t get itself printed these
days.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:3em;'>&#8220;Yours as usual,</p>
<p>&#8220;C. J.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>The communication was probably intended
as encouragement, but the effect was depressing,
and at the end of an hour, Harlan had
written only two lines more in his book,
neither of which pleased him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dick was renewing his old acquaintance
with Mrs. Smithers, much to that
lady&#8217;s pleasure, though she characteristically
endeavoured to conceal it. She belonged to
a pious sect which held all mirth to be
ungodly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sally,&#8221; Dick was saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve dreamed
of your biscuits night and day since I ate the
last one. Are we going to have &#8217;em for
lunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No biscuits in this house to-day,&#8221; grumbled
the deity of the kitchen, in an attempt to
be properly stern, &#8220;and as I&#8217;ve told you more
than once, my name ain&#8217;t &#8216;Sally.&#8217; It&#8217;s Mis&#8217;
Smithers, that&#8217;s wot it is, and I&#8217;ll thank you
to call me by it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Between those who love,&#8221; continued
Dick, with a sidelong glance at Dorothy, who
stood near by, appalled at his daring, &#8220;the
best is none too good for common use. If
my heart breaks the bonds of conventional
restraint, and I call you by the name under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
which you always appear to me in my longing
dreams, why should you not be gracious,
and forgive me? Be kind to me, Sally, be
just a little kind, and throw together a pan of
those biscuits in your own inimitable style!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along with you, you limb of Satan,&#8221;
cried Mrs. Smithers, brandishing a floury
spoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Dorothy,&#8221; said Dick, laying
a huge but friendly paw upon Mrs. Carr&#8217;s
shoulder; &#8220;we&#8217;re chased out.&#8221; He put his
head back into the kitchen, however, to file a
parting petition for biscuits, which was unnecessary,
for Mrs. Smithers had already
found her rolling-pin and had begun to sift her
flour.</p>
<p>Outside, he duly admired Maud, who was
chewing the cud of reflection under a tree,
created a panic in the chicken yard by lifting
Abdul Hamid ignominiously by the legs, to
see how heavy he was, and chased Claudius
Tiberius under the barn.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that cat turns up missing some day,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t blame me. He looks so much
like Uncle Ebeneezer that I can&#8217;t stand for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer about Claudius,
anyway,&#8221; ventured Dorothy. &#8220;Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
Smithers says that uncle killed him the week
before he died, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before who died?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claudius&mdash;no, before uncle died, and she
buried him, and he&#8217;s come to life again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle, or Claudius?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claudius, you goose,&#8221; laughed Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I knew just how nearly related we
were,&#8221; remarked Dick, irrelevantly enough,
&#8220;I believe I&#8217;d kiss you. You look so pretty
with all your dimples hung out and your hair
blowing in the wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy glanced up, startled, and inclined
to be angry, but it was impossible to take
offence at such a mischievous youth as Dick
was at that moment. &#8220;We&#8217;re not related,&#8221;
she said, coolly, &#8220;except by marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s near enough,&#8221; returned
Dick, who was never disposed to be unduly
critical. &#8220;Your husband is only related to
you by marriage. Don&#8217;t be such a prude.
Come to the waiting arms of your uncle, or
cousin, or brother-in-law, or whatever it is
that I happen to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and kiss your friend Sally in the
kitchen,&#8221; laughed Dorothy. &#8220;You have my
permission.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Dick made a wry face. &#8220;I don&#8217;t hanker to
do it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but if you want me to, I
will. I suppose she isn&#8217;t pleased with her
place and you want to make it more homelike
for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What relation were you to Uncle Ebeneezer?&#8221;
queried Dorothy, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle and I,&#8221; sighed Dick, &#8220;were connected
by the closest ties of blood and marriage.
Nobody could be more related than
we were. I was the only child of Aunt
Rebecca&#8217;s sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s sister&#8217;s husband&#8217;s
sister. Say, on the dead, if I ever bother you
will you tell me so and invite me to skip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake hands on it, then; that&#8217;s a good
fellow. And say, did you say there was another
skirt stopping here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A&mdash;a what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Petticoat,&#8221; explained Dick, patiently;
&#8220;mulier, as the ancient dagoes had it.
They&#8217;ve been getting mulier ever since, too.
How old is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; answered Dorothy. &#8220;She&#8217;s not
more than twenty or twenty-one.&#8221; Then,
endeavouring to be just to Elaine, she added:
&#8220;And a very pretty girl, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lead me to her,&#8221; exclaimed Dick ecstatically.
&#8220;Already she is mine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see her at luncheon. There&#8217;s the
bell, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Chester was duly presented to Miss
St. Clair, and from then on, appeared to be on
his good behaviour. Elaine&#8217;s delicate, fragile
beauty appealed strongly to the susceptible
Dick, and from the very beginning, he was
afraid of her&mdash;a dangerous symptom, if he had
only known it.</p>
<p>Harlan, making the best of a bad bargain,
devoted himself to his guests impartially, and,
upon the whole, the luncheon went off very
well, though the atmosphere was not wholly
festive.</p>
<p>Afterward, when they sat down in the parlour,
there was an awkward pause which no
one seemed inclined to relieve. At length
Dorothy, mindful of her duty as hostess,
asked Miss St. Clair if she would not play
something.</p>
<p>Willingly enough, Elaine went to the melodeon,
which had not been opened since the
Carrs came to live at the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern, and
lifted the lid. Immediately, however, she went
off into hysterics, which were so violent that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Harlan and Dorothy were obliged to assist her
to her room.</p>
<p>Dick strongly desired to carry Elaine upstairs,
but was forbidden by the hampering
conventionalities. So he lounged over to the
melodeon, somewhat surprised to find that
&#8220;It&#8221; was still there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8221; was a brown, wavy, false front of
human hair, securely anchored to the keys
underneath by a complicated system of
loops of linen thread. Pinned to the top
was a faded slip of paper on which Uncle
Ebeneezer had written, long ago: &#8220;Mrs. Judson
always kept her best false front in the
melodeon. I do not desire to have it disturbed.&mdash;E. J.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His Nibs never could bear music,&#8221; thought
Dick, as he closed the instrument, little guessing
that a vein of sentiment in Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
hard nature had impelled him to keep
the prosaic melodeon forever sacred to the
slender, girlish fingers that had last brought
music from its yellowed keys.</p>
<p>From upstairs still came the sound of crying,
which was not altogether to be wondered at,
considering Miss St. Clair&#8217;s weak, nervous
condition. Harlan came down, scowling, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
took back the brandy flask, moving none too
hastily.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t like Elaine,&#8221; murmured Dick
to himself, vaguely troubled. &#8220;I wonder
why&mdash;oh, I wonder why!&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Blue as sapphires were the eyes of Elaine,
and her fair cheek was like that of an apple
blossom. Set like a rose upon pearl was the
dewy, fragrant sweetness of her mouth, and
her breath was that of the rose itself. Her
hands&mdash;but how shall I write of the flower-like
hands of Elaine? They seemed all too
frail to hold the reins of her palfrey, much
less to guide him along the rocky road that lay
before her.</i></p>
<p><i>Safely sheltered in a sunny valley was the
Castle of Content, wherein Elaine&#8217;s father
reigned as Lord. Upon the hills close at
hand were the orchards, which were now in
bloom. A faint, unearthly sweetness came
with every passing breeze, and was wafted
through the open windows of the Castle,
where, upon the upper floor, Elaine was wont
to sit with her maids at the tapestry frames.</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p><i>But, of late, a strange restlessness was
upon her, and the wander-lust surged through
her veins.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I am fain to
leave the Castle of Content, and set out upon
the Heart&#8217;s Quest. Among the gallant knights
of thy retinue, there is none whom I would
wed, and it is seemly that I should set out to
find my lord and master, for behold, father,
as thou knowest, twenty years and more have
passed over my head, and my beauty hath begun
to fade.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>The Lord of the Castle of Content smiled
in amusement, that Elaine, the beautiful,
should fancy her charms were on the wane.
But he was ever eager to gratify the slightest
wish of this only child of his, and so he gave
his ready consent.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Indeed, Elaine,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and if
thou choosest, thou shalt go, but these despised
knights shall attend thee, and also our new
fool, who hath come from afar to make merry
in our court. His motley is of an unfamiliar
pattern, his quips and jests savour not so much
of antiquity, and his songs are pleasing. He
shall lighten the rigours of thy journey and
cheer thee when thou art sad.&#8221;</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p><i>&#8220;But, father, I do not choose to have the
fool.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Say no more, Elaine, for if thou goest,
thou shall have the fool. It is most fitting
that in thy retinue there shouldst be more
than one to wear the cap and bells, and it is in
my mind to consider this quest of thine somewhat
more than mildly foolish. Unnumbered
brave and faithful knights are at thy feet and
yet thou canst not choose, but must needs fare
onward in search of a stranger to be thy lord
and master.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Elaine raised her hand. &#8220;As thou wilt,
father,&#8221; she said, submissively. &#8220;Thou canst
not understand the way of a maid. Bid thy
fool to prepare himself quickly for a long
journey, since we start at sunset.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;But why at sunset, daughter? The way
is long. Mayst not thy mission wait until
sunrise?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Nay, father, for it is my desire to sleep to-night
upon the ground. The tapestried walls
of my chamber stifle me and I would fain lie in
the fresh air with only the green leaves for my
canopy and the stars for my taper lights.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;As thou wilt, Elaine, but my heart is sad at
the prospect of losing thee. Thou art my only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
child, the image of thy dead mother, and my
old eyes shall be misty for the sight of thee
long before my gallant knights bring thee back
again.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;So shall I gain some hours, father,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Perhaps my sunset journeying
shall bring my return a day nearer. Cross
me not in this wish, father, for it is my fancy
to go.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>So it was that the cavalcade was made ready
and Elaine and her company left the Castle of
Content at sunset. Two couriers rode at the
head, to see that the way was clear, and with
a silver bugle to warn travellers to stand aside
until the Lady Elaine and her attendants had
passed.</i></p>
<p><i>Upon a donkey, caparisoned in a most amusing
manner, rode Le Jongleur, the new fool of
whom the Lord of the Castle of Content had
spoken. His motley, as has been said, was of
an unfamiliar pattern, but was none the less
striking, being made wholly of scarlet and gold.
The Lady Elaine could not have guessed that
it was assumed as a tribute to the trappings of
her palfrey, for Le Jongleur&#8217;s heart was most
humble and loyal, though leaping now with the
joy of serving the fair Lady Elaine.</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p><i>The Lord of Content stood at the portal of
the Castle to bid the retinue Godspeed, and as
the cymbals crashed out a sounding farewell,
he impatiently wiped away the mist, which
already had clouded his vision. Long he
waited, straining his eyes toward the distant
cliffs, where, one by one, the company rode
upward. The valley was in shadow, but
the long light lay upon the hills, changing the
crags to a wonder of purple and gold. To
him, too, came the breath of apple bloom, but
it brough no joy to his troubled heart.</i></p>
<p><i>What dangers lay in wait for Elaine as she
fared forth upon her wild quest? What
monsters haunted the primeval forests through
which her path must lie? And where was the
knight who should claim her innocent and
maidenly heart? At this thought, the Lord
of Content shuddered, then was quickly
ashamed.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;I am as foolish,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;as he in
motley, who rides at the side of Elaine.
Surely my daughter, the child of a soldier,
can make no unworthy choice.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>The cavalcade had reached the summit of
the cliff, now, and at the brink, turned back.
The cymbals and the bugles pealed forth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
another sounding farewell to the Lord of the
Castle of Content, whom Elaine well knew was
waiting in the shadow of the portal till her
company should be entirely lost to sight.</i></p>
<p><i>The last light shone upon the wonderful
mass of gold which rippled to her waist, unbound,
from beneath her close-fitting scarlet
cap, and gave her an unearthly beauty. Le
Jongleur held aloft his bauble, making it to
nod in merry fashion, but the Lord of Content
did not see, his eyes being fixed upon Elaine.
She waved her hand to him, but he could not
answer, for his shoulders were shaking with
grief, nor, indeed, across the merciless distance
that lay between, could he guess at
Elaine&#8217;s whispered prayer: &#8220;Dear Heavenly
Father, keep thou my earthly father safe and
happy, till his child comes back again.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Over the edge of the cliff and out upon a
wide plain they fared. Ribbons of glorious
colour streamed from the horizon to the zenith,
and touched to flame the cymbals and the
bugles and the trappings of the horses and the
shields of the knights. Piercingly sweet, across
the fields of blowing clover, came the even song
of a feathered chorister, and</i>&mdash;what on earth
was that noise?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Harlan went to the window impatiently,
like one wakened from a dream by a blind
impulse of action.</p>
<p>The village stage, piled high with trunks,
was at his door, and from the cavernous
depths of the vehicle, shrieks of juvenile terror
echoed and re-echoed unceasingly. Mr.
Blake, driving, merely waited in supreme
unconcern.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the hereafter,&#8221; muttered Harlan,
savagely. &#8220;More old lovers of Dorothy&#8217;s,
I suppose, or else the&mdash;Good Lord, it&#8217;s
twins!&#8221;</p>
<p>A child of four or five fell out of the stage,
followed by another, who lit unerringly on
top of the prostrate one. In the meteoric
moment of the fall, Harlan had seen that the
two must have discovered America at about
the same time, for they were exactly alike,
making due allowance for the slight difference
made by masculine and feminine attire.</p>
<p>An enormous doll, which to Harlan&#8217;s
troubled sight first appeared to be an infant
in arms, was violently ejected from the stage
and added to the human pile which was
wriggling and weeping upon the gravelled
walk. A cub of seven next leaped out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
whistling shrilly, then came a querulous,
wailing, feminine voice from the interior.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie,&#8221; it whined, &#8220;how can you act so?
Help your little brother and sister up and get
Rebbie&#8217;s doll.&#8221;</p>
<p>To this the lad paid no attention whatever,
and the mother herself assorted the weeping
pyramid on the walk. Harlan ran downstairs,
feeling that the hour had come to defend his
hearthstone from outsiders. Dick and Dorothy
were already at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Foundlings&#8217; Home,&#8221; explained Dick,
briefly, with a wink at Harlan. &#8220;They&#8217;re
late this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy was speechless with amazement
and despair. Before Harlan had begun to
think connectedly, one of the twins had darted
into the house and bumped its head on the
library door, thereupon making the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern
hideous with much lamentation.</p>
<p>The mother, apparently tired out, came in as
though she had left something of great value
there and had come to get it, pausing only
to direct Harlan to pay the stage driver, and
have her trunks taken into the rooms opening
off the dining-room on the south side.</p>
<p>Willie took a mouth-organ out of his pocket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and rendered a hitherto unknown air upon it
with inimitable vigour. In the midst of the
confusion, Claudius Tiberius had the misfortune
to appear, and, immediately perceiving
his mistake, whisked under the sofa, from
whence the other twin determinedly haled
him, using the handle which Nature had evidently
intended for that purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you kindly tell me,&#8221; demanded Mrs.
Carr, when she could make herself heard,
&#8220;what is the meaning of all this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not understand you,&#8221; said the mother
of the twins, coldly. &#8220;Were you addressing
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; returned Mrs. Carr, to Dick&#8217;s
manifest delight. &#8220;I desire to know why
you have come to my house, uninvited, and
made all this disturbance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; exclaimed the woman, trembling
with anger. &#8220;Will you please send for
Mr. Judson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Judson,&#8221; said Dorothy, icily, &#8220;has
been dead for some time. This house is the
property of my husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! And who may your husband be?&#8221;
The tone of the question did not indicate even
faint interest in the subject under discussion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Dorothy turned, but Harlan had long since
beat an ignominious retreat, closely followed
by Dick, whose idea, as audibly expressed,
was that the women be allowed to &#8220;fight
it out by themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can readily understand,&#8221; went on Dorothy,
with a supreme effort at self-control,
&#8220;that you have made a mistake for which
you are not in any sense to blame. You are
tired from your journey, and you are quite
welcome to stay until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow!&#8221; shrilled the woman. &#8220;I
guess you don&#8217;t know who I am! I am Mrs.
Holmes, Rebecca Judson&#8217;s own cousin, and I
have spent the Summer here ever since Rebecca
was married! I guess if Ebeneezer
knew you were practically ordering his wife&#8217;s
own cousin out of his house, he&#8217;d rise from
his grave to haunt you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy fancied that Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
portrait moved slightly. Aunt Rebecca still
surveyed the room from the easel, gentle,
sweet-faced, and saintly. There was no resemblance
whatever between Aunt Rebecca
and the sallow, hollow-cheeked, wide-eyed
termagant, with a markedly receding chin,
who stood before Mrs. Carr and defied her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is my husband&#8217;s house,&#8221; suggested
Dorothy, pertinently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let your husband do the talking,&#8221;
rejoined Mrs. Holmes, sarcastically. &#8220;If he
was sure it was his, I guess he wouldn&#8217;t
have run away. I&#8217;ve always had my own
rooms here, and I intend to go and come as I
please, as I always have done. You can&#8217;t
make me believe that Ebeneezer gave my
apartments to your husband, nor him either,
and I wouldn&#8217;t advise any of you to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds of fearful panic came from the
chicken yard, and Dorothy rushed out, swiftly
laying avenging hands on the disturber of the
peace. One of the twins was chasing Abdul
Hamid around the coop with a lath, as he
explained between sobs, &#8220;to make him lay.&#8221;
Mrs. Holmes bore down upon Dorothy before
any permanent good had been done.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;How
dare you lay hands on my child! Come,
Ebbie, come to mamma. Bless his little heart,
he shall chase the chickens if he wants to, so
there, there. Don&#8217;t cry, Ebbie. Mamma will
get you another lath and you shall play with
the chickens all the afternoon. There, there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan appeared at this juncture, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
a few quiet, well-chosen words told Mrs.
Holmes that the chicken coop was his property,
and that neither now nor at any other
time should any one enter it without his express
permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Holmes,
still soothing the unhappy twin. &#8220;How
high and mighty we are when we&#8217;re living
off our poor dead uncle&#8217;s bounty! Telling
his wife&#8217;s own cousin what she&#8217;s to do, and
what she isn&#8217;t! Upon my word!&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, Mrs. Holmes retired to the
house, her pace hastened by howls from the
other twin, who was in trouble with her older
brother somewhere in her &#8220;apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy looked at Harlan, undecided
whether to laugh or to cry. &#8220;Poor little
woman,&#8221; he said, softly; &#8220;don&#8217;t you fret.
We&#8217;ll have them out of the house no later
than to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of them?&#8221; asked Dorothy, eagerly,
as Miss St. Clair strolled into the front yard.</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s brow clouded and he shifted uneasily
from one foot to the other. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
he said, slowly, &#8220;whether I&#8217;ve got nerve
enough to order a woman out of my house
or not. Let&#8217;s wait and see what happens.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>A sob choked Dorothy, and she ran swiftly
into the house, fortunately meeting no one on
her way to her room. Dick ventured out of
the barn and came up to Harlan, who was
plainly perplexed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very, very mild arrival,&#8221; commented Mr.
Chester, desiring to put his host at his ease.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never known &#8217;em to come so peacefully
as they have to-day. Usually there&#8217;s more or
less disturbance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disturbance,&#8221; repeated Harlan. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
we had a disturbance to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not,&#8221; answered Dick, placidly.
&#8220;Wait till young Ebeneezer and Rebecca get
more accustomed to their surroundings, and
then you&#8217;ll have a Fourth of July every
day, with Christmas, Thanksgiving, and St.
Patrick&#8217;s Day thrown in. Willie is the worst
little terror that ever went unlicked, and the
twins come next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you don&#8217;t understand children,&#8221;
remarked Harlan, with a patronising air, and
more from a desire to disagree with Dick than
from anything else. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always liked them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have,&#8221; commented Dick, with a
knowing chuckle, &#8220;you&#8217;re in a fair way to
get cured of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about these people,&#8221; said Harlan,
ignoring the speech, and dominated once more
by healthy human curiosity. &#8220;Who are they
and where do they come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re dwellers from the infernal regions,&#8221;
explained Dick, with an air of truthfulness,
&#8220;and they came from there because the
old Nick turned &#8217;em out. They were upsetting
things and giving the place a bad name.
Mrs. Holmes says she&#8217;s Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s cousin,
but nobody knows whether she is or not.
She&#8217;s come here every Summer since Aunt
Rebecca died, and poor old uncle couldn&#8217;t
help himself. He hinted more than once that
he&#8217;d enjoy her absence if she could be moved
to make herself scarce, but it had no more
effect than a snowflake would in the place she
came from. The most he could do was to
build a wing on the house with a separate
kitchen and dining-room in it, and take his
own meals in the library, with the door bolted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie is a Winter product and Judson
Centre isn&#8217;t a pleasant place in the cold
months, but the twins were born here, five
years ago this Summer. They came in the
night, but didn&#8217;t make any more trouble then
than they have every day since.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked Harlan, after
a thoughtful silence, &#8220;if you were in my
place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be tickled to death because a kind
Providence had married me to Dorothy instead
of to Mrs. Holmes. Poor old Holmes
is in his well-earned grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>With great dignity, Harlan walked into the
house, but Dick, occupied with his own
thoughts, did not guess that his host was
offended.</p>
<p>After the first excitement was over, comparative
peace settled down upon the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern.
Mrs. Holmes decided the question
of where she should eat, by setting four more
places at the table when Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s back
was turned. Dorothy did not appear at luncheon,
and Mrs. Smithers performed her duties
with such pronounced ungraciousness that
Elaine felt as though something was about to
explode.</p>
<p>A long sleep, born of nervous exhaustion,
came at last to Dorothy&#8217;s relief. When she
awoke, it was night and the darkness dazed
her at first. She sat up and rubbed her eyes,
wondering whether she had been dead, or
merely ill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>There was not a sound in the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern,
and the events of the day seemed like
some hideous nightmare which waking had
put to rout. She bathed her face in cool
water, then went to look out of the window.</p>
<p>A lantern moved back and forth under the
trees in the orchard, and a tall, dark figure,
armed with a spade, accompanied it. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Harlan,&#8221; thought Dorothy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go down
and see what he&#8217;s burying.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was only Mrs. Smithers, who appeared
much startled when she saw her mistress
at her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; demanded Dorothy,
seeing that Mrs. Smithers had dug a hole at
least a foot and a half each way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a-satisfyin&#8217; myself,&#8221; explained the
handmaiden, with a note of triumph in her
voice, &#8220;about that there cat. &#8217;Ere&#8217;s where I
buried &#8217;im, and &#8217;ere&#8217;s where there ain&#8217;t no signs
of &#8217;is dead body. &#8217;E&#8217;s come back to &#8217;aunt us,
that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e &#8217;as, and your uncle&#8217;ll be the
next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so foolish,&#8221; snapped Dorothy.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten the place, that&#8217;s all, and I
don&#8217;t wish to hear any more of this nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Oo was it?&#8221; asked Mrs. Smithers, &#8220;as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
come out of a warm bed at midnight to see as
if folks wot was diggin&#8217; for cats found anythink?
&#8217;T warn&#8217;t me, Miss, that&#8217;s wot it
warn&#8217;t, and I take it that them as follers is
as nonsensical as them wot digs. Anyhow,
Miss, &#8217;ere&#8217;s where &#8217;e was buried, and &#8217;ere&#8217;s
where &#8217;e ain&#8217;t now. You can think wot you
likes, that&#8217;s wot you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claudius Tiberius suddenly materialised out
of the surrounding darkness, and after sniffing
at the edge of the hole, jumped in to investigate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see that, Miss?&#8221; quavered Mrs.
Smithers. &#8220;&#8217;E knows where &#8217;e&#8217;s been, and
&#8217;e knows where &#8217;e ain&#8217;t now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Smithers,&#8221; said Dorothy, sternly,
&#8220;will you kindly fill up that hole and come
into the house and go to bed? I don&#8217;t want
to be kept awake all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be kept awake, Miss,&#8221;
said Mrs. Smithers, slowly filling up the hole.
&#8220;The worst is &#8217;ere already and wot&#8217;s comin&#8217;
is comin&#8217; anyway, and besides,&#8221; she added,
as an afterthought, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t a blessed one
of &#8217;em come &#8217;ere at night since your uncle
fixed over the house.&#8221;</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>Another</h3>
</div>

<p>For the first time in her life, Mrs. Carr
fully comprehended the sensations of a
wild animal caught in a trap. In her present
painful predicament, she was absolutely helpless,
and she realised it. It was Harlan&#8217;s
house, as he had said, but so powerful and
penetrating was the personality of the dead
man that she felt as though it was still largely
the property of Uncle Ebeneezer.</p>
<p>The portrait in the parlour gave her no
light upon the subject, though she studied it
earnestly. The face was that of an old man,
soured and embittered by what Life had
brought him, who seemed now to have a
peculiarly malignant aspect. Dorothy fancied,
in certain morbid moments, that Uncle Ebeneezer,
from some safe place, was keenly relishing
the whole situation.</p>
<p>Upon her soul, too, lay heavily that ancient
Law of the House, which demands unfailing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
courtesy to the stranger within our gates.
Just why the eating of our bread and salt by
some undesired guest should exert any particular
charm of immunity, has long been an
open question, but the Law remains.</p>
<p>She felt, dimly, that the end was not yet&mdash;that
still other strangers were coming to the
Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern for indefinite periods. She
saw, now, why wing after wing had been
added to the house, but could not understand
the odd arrangement of the front windows.
Through some inner sense of loyalty to Uncle
Ebeneezer, she forebore to question either
Mrs. Smithers or Dick&mdash;two people who
could probably have given her some light on
the subject. She had gathered, however,
from hints dropped here and there, as well
as from the overpowering evidence of recent
events, that a horde of relatives swarmed each
Summer at the queer house on the hilltop and
remained until late Autumn.</p>
<p>Harlan said nothing, and nowadays Dorothy
saw very little of him. Most of the time
he was at work in the library, or else taking
long, solitary rambles through the surrounding
country. At meals he was moody and taciturn,
his book obliterating all else from his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>He doubtless knew, subconsciously, that
his house was disturbed by alien elements,
but he dwelt too securely in the upper regions
to be troubled by the obvious fact. Once in
the library, with every door securely bolted,
he could afford to laugh at the tumult outside,
if, indeed, he should ever become aware of its
existence. The children might make the very
air vocal with their howls, Elaine might have
hysterics, Mrs. Smithers render hymns in a
cracked, squeaky voice, and Dick whistle
eternally, but Harlan was in a strange new
country, with a beautiful lady, a company of
gallant knights, and a jester.</p>
<p>The rest was all unreal. He seemed to see
people through a veil, to hear what they said
without fully comprehending it, and to walk
through his daily life blindly, without any
sort of emotion. Worst of all, Dorothy
herself seemed detached and dream-like. He
saw that her face was white and her eyes sad,
but it affected him not at all. He had yet to
learn that in this, as in everything else, a price
must inevitably be paid, and that the sudden
change of all his loved realities to hazy visions
was the terrible penalty of his craft.</p>
<p>Yet there was compensation, which is also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
inevitable. To him, the book was vital,
reaching down into the very heart of the
world. Fancy took his work, and, to the eyes
of its creator, made it passing fair. At times
he would sit for an hour or more, nibbling at
the end of his pencil, only negatively conscious,
like one who stares fixedly at a blank
wall. Presently, Elaine and her company
would come back again, and he would go on
with them, writing down only what he saw
and felt.</p>
<p>Chapter after chapter was written and
tossed feverishly aside. The words beat in
his pulses like music, each one with its own
particular significance. In return for his personal
effacement came moments of supremest
joy, when his whole world was aflame with
light, and colour, and sound, and his physical
body fairly shook with ecstasy.</p>
<p>Little did he know that the Cup was in his
hands, and that he was draining it to the very
dregs of bitterness. For this temporary intoxication,
he must pay in every hour of his
life to come. Henceforward he was set apart
from his fellows, painfully isolated, eternally
alone. He should have friends, but only for
the hour. The stranger in the street should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
be the same to him as one he had known for
many years, and he should be equally ready,
at any moment, to cast either aside. With a
quick, merciless insight, like the knife of a surgeon
used without an anæsthetic, he should
explore the inmost recesses of every personality
with which he came in contact, involuntarily,
and find himself interested only
as some new trait or capacity was revealed.
Calm and emotionless, urged by some hidden
power, he should try each individual to see
of what he was made; observing the man
under all possible circumstances, and at times
enmeshing new circumstances about him. He
should sacrifice himself continually if by so
doing he could find the deep roots of the
other man&#8217;s selfishness, and, conversely, be
utterly selfish if necessary to discover the
other&#8217;s power of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Unknowingly, he had ceased to be a man
and had become a ferret. It was no light payment
exacted in return for the pleasure of writing
about Elaine. He had the ability to live in
any place or century he pleased, but he had
paid for it by putting his present reality upon
precisely the same footing. Detachment was
his continually. Henceforth he was a spectator
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
merely, without any particular concern
in what passed before his eyes. Some people
he should know at a glance, others in a week,
a month, or a year. Across the emptiness
between them, some one should clasp his
hand, yet share no more his inner life than
one who lies beside a dreamer and thinks
thus to know where the other wanders on
the strange trails of sleep.</p>
<p>In the dregs of the Cup lay the potential
power to cast off his present life as a mollusk
leaves his shell, and as completely forget it.
For Love, and Death, and Pain are only symbols
to him who is enslaved by the pen.
Moreover, he suffers always the pangs of an
unsatisfied hunger, the exquisite torture of an
unappeased and unappeasable thirst, for something
which, like a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, hovers
ever above and beyond him, past the power
of words to interpret or express.</p>
<p>It is often reproachfully said that one
&#8220;makes copy&#8221; of himself and his friends&mdash;that
nothing is too intimately sacred to be
seized upon and dissected in print. Not so
long ago, it was said that a certain man
was &#8220;botanising on his mother&#8217;s grave,&#8221; a
pardonable confusion, perhaps, of facts and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
realities. The bitter truth is that the writer
lives his books&mdash;and not much else. From
title to colophon, he escapes no pang,
misses no joy. The life of the book is his
from beginning to end. At the close of it,
he has lived what his dream people have lived
and borne the sorrows of half a dozen entire
lifetimes, mercilessly concentrated into the few
short months of writing.</p>
<p>One by one, his former pleasures vanish.
Even the divine consolation of books is partly
if not wholly gone. Behind the printed
page, he sees ever the machinery of composition,
the preparation for climax, the repetition
in its proper place, the introduction and interweaving
of major and minor, of theme and
contrast. For the fine, glowing fancy of the
other man has not appeared in his book, and
to the eye of the fellow-craftsman only the
mechanism is there. Mask-like, the author
stands behind his Punch-and-Judy box, twitching
the strings that move his marionettes,
heedless of the fact that in his audience there
must be a few who know him surely for what
he is.</p>
<p>If only the transfiguring might of the Vision
could be put into print, there would be little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
in the world save books. Happily heedless
of the mockery of it all, Harlan laboured on,
destined fully to sense his entire payment
much later, suffer vicariously for a few hours
on account of it, then to forget.</p>
<p>Dorothy, meanwhile, was learning a hard
lesson. Harlan&#8217;s changeless preoccupation
hurt her cruelly, but, woman-like, she considered
it a manifestation of genius and endeavoured
to be proud accordingly. It had
not occurred to her that there could ever be
anything in Harlan&#8217;s thought into which she
was not privileged to go. She had thought of
marriage as a sort of miraculous welding of
two individualities into one, and was perceiving
that it changed nothing very much;
that souls went on their way unaltered. She
saw, too, that there was no one in the wide
world who could share her every mood and
tense, that ultimately each one of us lives and
dies alone, within the sanctuary of his own
inner self, cheered only by some passing mood
of friend or stranger, which chances to chime
with his.</p>
<p>It was Dick who, blindly enough, helped
her over many a hard place, and quickened
her sense of humour into something upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
which she might securely lean. He was too
young and too much occupied with the obvious
to look further, but he felt that Dorothy
was troubled, and that it was his duty, as
a man and a gentleman, to cheer her up.</p>
<p>Privately, he considered Harlan an amiable
kind of a fool, who shut himself up needlessly
in a musty library when he might be outdoors,
or talking with a charming woman, or both.
When he discovered that Harlan had hitherto
earned his living by writing and hoped to
continue doing it, he looked upon his host
with profound pity. Books, to Dick, were
among the things which kept life from being
wholly pleasant and agreeable. He had gone
through college because otherwise he would
have been separated from his friends, and because
a small legacy from a distant relative,
who had considerately died at an opportune
moment, enabled him to pay for his tuition
and his despised books.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never a pig, though,&#8221; he explained
to Dorothy, in a confidential moment.
&#8220;There was one chump in our class who
wanted to know all there was in the book,
and made himself sick trying to cram it in.
All of a sudden, he graduated. He left college
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
feet first, three on a side, with the class walking
slow behind him. I never was like that. I
was sort of an epicure when it came to knowledge,
tasting delicately here and there, and
never greedy. Why, as far back as when
I was studying algebra, I nobly refused to
learn the binomial theorem. I just read it
through once, hastily, like taking one sniff at
a violet, and then let it alone. The other fellows
fairly gorged themselves with it, but I
didn&#8217;t&mdash;I had too much sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mr. Chester had been there a week,
he gave Dorothy two worn and crumpled
two-dollar bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; she asked, curiously.
&#8220;Where did you find it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Find it&#8217; is good,&#8221; laughed Dick. &#8220;I
earned it, my dear lady, in hard and uncongenial
toil. It&#8217;s my week&#8217;s board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to pay any board here.
You&#8217;re a guest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life. You don&#8217;t suppose
I&#8217;m going to sponge my keep off anybody,
do you? I paid Uncle Ebeneezer board right
straight along and there&#8217;s no reason why I
shouldn&#8217;t pay you. You can put that away
in your sock, or wherever it is that women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
keep money, or else I take the next train. If
you don&#8217;t want to lose me, you have to accept
four plunks every Monday. I&#8217;ve got lots of
four plunks,&#8221; he added, with a winning
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Dorothy, quite certain
that she could not spare Dick. &#8220;If it will
make you feel any better about staying, I&#8217;ll
take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had quickly made friends with Elaine,
and the three made a more harmonious group
than might have been expected under the circumstances.
With returning strength and
health, Miss St. Clair began to take more of
an interest in her surroundings. She gathered
the white clover blossoms in which Dorothy
tied up her pats of sweet butter, picked berries
in the garden, skimmed the milk, helped
churn, and fed the chickens.</p>
<p>Dick took entire charge of the cow, thus
relieving Mrs. Smithers of an uncongenial
task and winning her heartfelt gratitude. She
repaid him with unnumbered biscuits of his
favourite kind and with many a savoury
&#8220;snack&#8221; between meals. He also helped
Dorothy in many other ways. It was Dick
who collected the eggs every morning and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
took them to the sanitarium, along with such
other produce as might be ready for the market.
He secured astonishing prices for the
things he sold, and set it down to man&#8217;s superior
business ability when questioned by
his hostess. Dorothy never guessed that
most of the money came out of his own
pocket, and was charged up, in the ragged
memorandum book which he carried, to
&#8220;Elaine&#8217;s board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss St. Clair had never thought of offering
compensation, and no one suggested it to her,
but Dick privately determined to make good
the deficiency, sure that a woman married to
&#8220;a writing chump&#8221; would soon be in need
of ready money if not actually starving at the
time. That people should pay for what Harlan
wrote seemed well-nigh incredible. Besides,
though Dick had never read that &#8220;love
is an insane desire on the part of a man to pay
a woman&#8217;s board bill for life,&#8221; he took a definite
satisfaction out of this secret expenditure,
which he did not stop to analyse.</p>
<p>He brought back full price for everything he
took to the &#8220;repair-shop,&#8221; as he had irreverently
christened the sanitarium, though he
seldom sold much. On the other side of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
hill he had a small but select graveyard where
he buried such unsalable articles as he could
not eat. His appetite was capricious, and
Dorothy had frequently observed that when
he came back from the long walk to the sanitarium,
he ate nothing at all.</p>
<p>He established a furniture factory under a
spreading apple tree at a respectable distance
from the house, and began to remodel the
black-walnut relics which were evidence of
his kinsman&#8217;s poor taste. He took many a
bed apart, scraped off the disfiguring varnish,
sandpapered and oiled the wood, and put it
together in new and beautiful forms. He
made several tables, a cabinet, a bench, half
a dozen chairs, a set of hanging shelves, and
even aspired to a desk, which, owing to the
limitations of the material, was not wholly
successful.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Elaine sat in rocking-chairs under
the tree and encouraged him while he
worked. One of them embroidered a simple
design upon a burlap curtain while the other
read aloud, and together they planned a
shapely remodelling of the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern.
Fortunately, the woodwork was plain, and
the ceilings not too high.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Elaine, &#8220;that the big living
room with the casement windows will be
perfectly beautiful. You couldn&#8217;t have anything
lovelier than this dull walnut with the
yellow walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever Mrs. Carr&#8217;s thoughts might be,
this simple sentence was usually sufficient to
turn the current into more pleasant channels.
She had planned to have needless partitions
taken out, and make the whole lower floor
into one room, with only a dining-room, kitchen,
and pantry back of it. She would
take up the unsightly carpets, over which impossible
plants wandered persistently, and
have them woven into rag rugs, with green
and brown and yellow borders. The floor
was to be stained brown and the pine woodwork
a soft, old green. Yellow walls and
white net curtains, with the beautiful furniture
Dick was making, completed a very charming
picture in the eyes of a woman who loved
her home.</p>
<p>Outspeeding it in her fancy was the finer,
truer living which she believed lay beyond.
Some day she and Harlan, alone once
more, with the cobwebs of estrangement
swept away, should begin a new and happier
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
honeymoon in the transformed house. When
the book was done&mdash;ah, when the book
was done! But he was not reading any part
of it to her now and would not let her begin
copying it on the typewriter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it myself, when I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; he
said, coldly. &#8220;I can use a typewriter just as
well as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy sighed, unconsciously, for the
woman&#8217;s part is always to wait patiently
while men achieve, and she who has learned
to wait patiently, and be happy meanwhile,
has learned the finest art of all&mdash;the art of
life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;that&#8217;s a peach of a
table, if I do say it as shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>They readily agreed with him, for it was
low and massive, built on simple, dignified
lines, and beautifully finished. The headboards
of three ponderous walnut beds and
the supporting columns of a hideous sideboard
had gone into its composition, thus
illustrating, as Dorothy said, that ugliness may
be changed to beauty by one who knows
how and is willing to work for it.</p>
<p>The noon train whistled shrilly in the distance,
and Dorothy started out of her chair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
&#8220;She&#8217;s afraid,&#8221; laughed Dick, instantly comprehending.
&#8220;She&#8217;s afraid somebody is
coming on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More twins?&#8221; queried Elaine, from the
depths of her rocker. &#8220;Surely there can&#8217;t be
any more twins?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Dorothy, vaguely
troubled. &#8220;Someway, I feel as though
something terrible were going to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing happened, however, until after
luncheon, just as she had begun to breathe
peacefully again. Willie saw the procession
first and ran back with gleeful shouts to
make the announcement. So it was that
the entire household, including Harlan, formed
a reception committee on the front porch.</p>
<p>Up the hill, drawn by two straining horses,
came what appeared at first to be a pyramid
of furniture, but later resolved itself into the
component parts of a more ponderous bed
than the ingenuity of man had yet contrived.
It was made of black walnut, and was at least
three times as heavy as any of those in the
Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern. On the top of the mass was
perched a little old man in a skull cap, a slippered
foot in a scarlet sock airily waving at
one side. A bright green coil closely clutched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
in his withered hands was the bed cord
appertaining to the bed&mdash;a sainted possession
from which its owner sternly refused to
part.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; shouted Dick; &#8220;it&#8217;s Uncle
Israel and his crib!&#8221;</p>
<p>Paying no heed to the assembled group,
Uncle Israel dismounted nimbly enough, and
directed the men to take his bed upstairs,
which they did, while Harlan and Dorothy
stood by helplessly. Here, under his profane
and involved direction, the structure was
finally set in place, even to the patchwork
quilt, fearfully and wonderfully made, which
surmounted it all.</p>
<p>Financial settlement was waved aside by
Uncle Israel as a matter in which he was not
interested, and it was Dick who counted out
two dimes and a nickel to secure peace. A
supplementary procession appeared with a
small, weather-beaten trunk, a folding bath-cabinet,
and a huge case which, from Uncle
Israel&#8217;s perturbation, evidently contained numerous
fragile articles of great value.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Ebeneezer,&#8221; wheezed the newcomer,
&#8220;that I have arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ebeneezer,&#8221; replied Dick, in wicked imitation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
of the old man&#8217;s asthmatic speech, &#8220;has
been dead for some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; creaked Uncle Israel, waving a
tremulous, bony hand suggestively toward
the door, &#8220;kindly leave me alone with my
grief.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h3>Still More</h3>
</div>

<p>Uncle Israel, whose other name was
Skiles, adjusted himself to his grief in
short order. The sounds which issued from
his room were not those commonly associated
with mourning. Dick, fully accustomed
to various noises, explained them for the
edification of the Carrs, who at present were
sorely in need of edification.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the bath cabinet,&#8221; remarked Mr.
Chester, with the air of a connoisseur. &#8220;He&#8217;s
setting it up near enough to the door so that
if anybody should come in unexpectedly while
it&#8217;s working, the whole thing will be tipped
over and the house set on fire. Uncle Israel
won&#8217;t have any lock or bolt on his door for
fear he should die in the night. He relies
wholly on the bath cabinet and moral suasion.
Nobody knocks on doors here, anyway&mdash;just
goes in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s his trunk. He keeps it under the
window. The bed is set up first, then the
bath cabinet, then the trunk, and last, but not
least, the medicine chest. He keeps his entire
pharmacop&oelig;ia on a table at the head of his
bed, with a candle and matches, so that if he
feels badly in the night, the proper remedy is
instantly at hand. He prepares some of his
medicines himself, but he isn&#8217;t bigoted about
it. He buys the rest at wholesale, and I&#8217;ll
eat my hat if he hasn&#8217;t got a full-sized bottle
of every patent medicine that&#8217;s on sale anywhere
in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How old,&#8221; asked Harlan, speaking for the
first time, &#8220;is Uncle Israel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something over ninety, I believe,&#8221; returned
Dick. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my book of vital
statistics, so I don&#8217;t know, exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long,&#8221; inquired Dorothy, with a
forced smile, &#8220;does Uncle Israel stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord bless you, my dear lady, Uncle Israel
stays all Summer. Hello&mdash;there are some
more!&#8221;</p>
<p>A private conveyance of uncertain age and
purposes drew up before the door. From it
dismounted a very slender young man of medium
height, whose long auburn hair hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
over his coat-collar and at times partially obscured
his soulful grey eyes. It resembled the
mane of a lion, except in colour. He carried
a small black valise, and a roll of manuscript
tied with a badly soiled ribbon.</p>
<p>An old lady followed, stepping cautiously,
but still finding opportunity to scrutinise the
group in the doorway, peering sharply over
her gold-bowed spectacles. It was she who
paid the driver, and even before the two
reached the house, it was evident that they
were not on speaking terms.</p>
<p>The young man offered Mr. Chester a thin,
tremulous hand which lay on Dick&#8217;s broad
palm in a nerveless, clammy fashion. &#8220;Pray,&#8221;
he said, in a high, squeaky voice, &#8220;convey my
greetings to dear Uncle Ebeneezer, and inform
him that I have arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am at present holding no communication
with Uncle Ebeneezer,&#8221; explained Dick.
&#8220;The wires are down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Ebeneezer?&#8221; demanded the old
lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead,&#8221; answered Dorothy, wearily; &#8220;dead,
dead. He&#8217;s been dead a long time. This is
our house&mdash;he left it to my husband and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that disturb you a mite,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
the old lady, cheerfully. &#8220;I like your looks a
whole lot, an&#8217; I&#8217;d just as soon stay with you
as with Ebeneezer. I dunno but I&#8217;d ruther.&#8221;</p>
<p>She must have been well past sixty, but her
scanty hair was as yet untouched with grey.
She wore it parted in the middle, after an ancient
fashion, and twisted at the back into a
tight little knob, from which the ends of a
wire hairpin protruded threateningly. Dorothy
reflected, unhappily, that the whole thing
was done up almost tight enough to play a
tune on.</p>
<p>For the rest, her attire was neat, though
careless. One had always the delusion that
part or all of it was on the point of coming
off.</p>
<p>The young man was wiping his weak eyes
upon a voluminous silk handkerchief which had
evidently seen long service since its last washing.
&#8220;Dear Uncle Ebeneezer,&#8221; he breathed,
running his long, bony fingers through his hair.
&#8220;I cannot tell you how heavily this blow falls
upon me. Dear Uncle Ebeneezer was a distinguished
patron of the arts. Our country
needs more men like him, men with fine appreciation,
vowed to the service of the Ideal.
If you will pardon me, I will now retire to my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
apartment and remain there a short time in
seclusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, he ran lightly upstairs, as one
who was thoroughly at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in&mdash;&#8221; began Harlan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Harold Vernon Perkins, poet,&#8221; said
Dick. &#8220;He&#8217;s got his rhyming dictionary and
all his odes with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without knowing,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;I
should have thought his name was Harold
or Arthur or Paul. He looks it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wa&#8217;n&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; interjected the old
lady, &#8220;that he come. I didn&#8217;t even sense
that he was on the same train as me till I hired
the carriage at the junction an&#8217; he clim&#8217; in. He
said he might as well come along as we was
both goin&#8217; to the same place, an&#8217; it would save
him walkin&#8217;, an&#8217; not cost me no more than &#8217;t
would anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>While she was speaking, she had taken off
her outer layer of drapery and her bonnet.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll just put these things in my room, my
dear,&#8221; she said to Dorothy, &#8220;an&#8217; then I&#8217;ll
come back an&#8217; talk to you. I like your looks
first-rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in&mdash;,&#8221; said Harlan, again, as the old
lady vanished into one of the lower wings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Belinda something,&#8221; answered Dick.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who she&#8217;s married to now.
She&#8217;s had bad luck with her husbands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr, deeply troubled, was leaning
against the wall in the hall, and Dick patted
her hand soothingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret,&#8221; he
said, cheerily; &#8220;I&#8217;m here to see you through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That being the case,&#8221; remarked Harlan,
with a certain acidity in his tone, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
back to my work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old lady appeared again as Harlan
slammed the library door, and suggested that
Dick should go away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Polite hint,&#8221; commented Mr. Chester, not
at all disturbed. &#8220;See you later.&#8221; He went
out, whistling, with his cap on the back of his
head and his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re a new relative, be n&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked the lady guest, eyeing Dorothy
closely. &#8220;I disremember seein&#8217; you before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mrs. Carr,&#8221; repeated Dorothy, mechanically.
&#8220;My husband, Harlan Carr, is
Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s nephew, and the house
was left to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do tell!&#8221; ejaculated the other. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t have thought it of Ebeneezer. I&#8217;m
Belinda Dodd, relict of Benjamin Dodd, deceased.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
How many are there here, my
dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss St. Clair, Mr. Chester, Mrs. Holmes
and her three children, Uncle Israel Skiles, and
you two, besides Mr. Carr, Mrs. Smithers,
and myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked the visitor, in evident
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;All!&#8221; repeated Dorothy. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that
enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord love you, my dear, it&#8217;s plain to be
seen that you ain&#8217;t never been here before.
Only them few an&#8217; so late in the season, too.
Why, there&#8217;s Cousin Si Martin, an&#8217; his wife,
an&#8217; their eight children, some of the children
bein&#8217; married an&#8217; havin&#8217; other children, an&#8217;
Sister-in-law Fanny Wood with her invalid
husband, her second husband, that is, an&#8217; Rebecca&#8217;s
Uncle James&#8217;s third wife with her two
daughters, an&#8217; Rebecca&#8217;s sister&#8217;s second husband
with his new wife an&#8217; their little boy,
an&#8217; Uncle Jason an&#8217; his stepson, the one that
has fits, an&#8217; Cousin Sally Simmons an&#8217; her
daughter, an&#8217; the four little Riley children an&#8217;
their Aunt Lucretia, an&#8217; Step-cousin Betsey
Skiles with her two nieces, though I misdoubt
their comin&#8217; this year. The youngest niece
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
had typhoid fever here last Summer for eight
weeks, an&#8217; Betsey thinks the location ain&#8217;t
healthy, in spite of it&#8217;s bein&#8217; so near the sanitarium.
She was threatenin&#8217; to get the health
department or somethin&#8217; after Ebeneezer an&#8217;
have the drinkin&#8217; water looked into, so&#8217;s they
didn&#8217;t part on the pleasantest terms, but in
the main we&#8217;ve all got along well together.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Betsey knowed Ebeneezer was dead,
she wouldn&#8217;t hesitate none about comin&#8217;,
typhoid or no typhoid. Mebbe it was her
fault some, for Ebeneezer wa&#8217;n&#8217;t to blame for
his drinkin&#8217; water no more &#8217;n I&#8217;d be. Our
minister used to say that there was no discipline
for the soul like livin&#8217; with folks, year in
an&#8217; year out hand-runnin&#8217;, an&#8217; Betsey is naturally
that kind. Ebeneezer always lived plain,
but we&#8217;re all simple folks, not carin&#8217; much for
style, so we never minded it. The air&#8217;s good
up here an&#8217; I dunno any better place to spend
the Summer. My gracious! You be n&#8217;t sick,
be you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do,&#8221; murmured
Dorothy, her white lips scarcely moving; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; responded Mrs. Dodd, &#8220;I
can see that I&#8217;ve upset you some. Perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
you&#8217;re one of them people that don&#8217;t like to
have other folks around you. I&#8217;ve heard of
such, comin&#8217; from the city. Why, I knew a
woman that lived in the city, an&#8217; she said she
didn&#8217;t know the name of the woman next
door to her after livin&#8217; there over eight
months,&mdash;an&#8217; their windows lookin&#8217; right into
each other, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate people!&#8221; cried Dorothy, in a passion
of anger. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want anybody here
but my husband and Mrs. Smithers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Set quiet, my dear, an&#8217; make your mind
easy. I&#8217;m sure Ebeneezer never intended his
death to make any difference in my spendin&#8217;
the Summer here, especially when I&#8217;m fresh
from another bereavement, but if you&#8217;re in
earnest about closin&#8217; your doors on your poor
dead aunt&#8217;s relations, why I&#8217;ll see what I
can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if you could!&#8221; Dorothy almost
screamed the words. &#8220;If you can keep any
more people from coming here, I&#8217;ll bless you
for ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child, I can see that you&#8217;re considerable
upset. Just get me the pen an&#8217; ink an&#8217;
some paper an&#8217; envelopes an&#8217; I&#8217;ll set down
right now an&#8217; write to the connection an&#8217; tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
&#8217;em that Ebeneezer&#8217;s dead an&#8217; bein&#8217; of unsound
mind at the last has willed the house
to strangers who refuse to open their doors
to the blood relations of poor dead Rebecca.
That&#8217;s all I can do an&#8217; I can&#8217;t promise that
it&#8217;ll work. Ebeneezer writ several times to
us all that he didn&#8217;t feel like havin&#8217; no more
company, but Rebecca&#8217;s relatives was all of
a forgivin&#8217; disposition an&#8217; never laid it up
against him. We all kep&#8217; on a-comin&#8217; just
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them,&#8221; cried Dorothy her eyes unusually
bright and her cheeks burning, &#8220;that
we&#8217;ve got smallpox here, or diphtheria, or a
lunatic asylum, or anything you like. Tell
them there&#8217;s a big dog in the yard that won&#8217;t
let anybody open the gate. Tell them anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just you leave it all to me, my dear,&#8221; said
Mrs. Dodd, soothingly. &#8220;On account of the
connection bein&#8217; so differently constituted,
I&#8217;ll have to tell &#8217;em all different. Disease
would keep away some an&#8217; fetch others.
Betsey Skiles, now, she feels to turn her
hand to nursin&#8217; an&#8217; I&#8217;ve knowed her to go
miles in the dead of Winter to set up with a
stranger that had some disease she wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
familiar with. Dogs would bring others an&#8217;
only scare a few. Just you leave it all to me.
There ain&#8217;t never no use in borrerin&#8217; trouble
an&#8217; givin&#8217; up your peace of mind as security,
&#8217;cause you don&#8217;t never get the security back.
I&#8217;ve been married enough to know that
there&#8217;s plenty of trouble in life besides what&#8217;s
looked for, an&#8217; it&#8217;ll get in, without your
holdin&#8217; open the door an&#8217; spreadin&#8217; a mat
out with &#8216;Welcome&#8217; on it. Did Ebeneezer
leave any property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the house and furniture,&#8221; answered
Dorothy, feeling that the whole burden of the
world had been suddenly shifted to her young
shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rebecca had a big diamond pin,&#8221; said
Mrs. Dodd, after a brief silence, &#8220;that she
allers said was to be mine when she got
through with it. Ebeneezer give it to her for
a weddin&#8217; present. You ain&#8217;t seen it layin&#8217;
around, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t seen it &#8216;laying around,&#8217;&#8221;
retorted Dorothy, conscious that she was
juggling with the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Mrs. Dodd, easily, nibbling
her pen holder, &#8220;when it comes to
light, just remember that it&#8217;s mine. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
doubt it&#8217;ll turn up sometime. An&#8217; now, my
dear, I&#8217;ll just begin on them letters. Cousin
Si Martin&#8217;s folks are a-packin&#8217; an&#8217; expectin&#8217; to
get here next week. I suppose you&#8217;re willin&#8217;
to furnish the stamps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Willing!&#8221; cried Dorothy, &#8220;I should say
yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd toiled long at her self-imposed
task, and, having finished it, went out into
the kitchen, where for an hour or more she
exchanged mortuary gossip with Mrs. Smithers,
every detail of the conversation being
keenly relished by both ladies.</p>
<p>At dinner-time, eleven people sat down to
partake of the excellent repast furnished by
Mrs. Smithers under the stimulus of pleasant
talk. Harlan was at the head, with Miss St.
Clair on his right and Mrs. Dodd on his left.
Next to Miss St. Clair was the poet, whose
deep sorrow did not interfere with his appetite.
The twins were next to him, then Mrs.
Holmes, then Willie, then Dorothy, at the
foot of the table. On her right was Dick, the
space between Dick and Mrs. Dodd being
occupied by Uncle Israel.</p>
<p>To a careless observer, it might have seemed
that Uncle Israel had more than his share of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
the table, but such in reality was not the case.
His plate was flanked by a goodly array of
medicine bottles, and cups and bowls of predigested
and patent food. Uncle Israel, as
Dick concisely expressed it, was &#8220;pie for the
cranks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My third husband,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Dodd,
pleasantly, well aware that she was touching
her neighbour&#8217;s sorest spot, &#8220;was terribly
afflicted with stomach trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only stomach trouble I&#8217;ve ever had,&#8221;
commented Mr. Chester, airily spearing another
biscuit with his fork, &#8220;was in getting
enough to put into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a care, young man,&#8221; wheezed Uncle
Israel, warningly. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; so
bad for the system as hot bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be bad for my system,&#8221; resumed
Dick, &#8220;not to be able to get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My third husband,&#8221; continued Mrs. Dodd,
disregarding the interruption, &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t
have no bread in the house at all. He et
these little straw mattresses, same as you&#8217;ve
got, so constant that he finally died from the
tic doleroo. Will you please pass me them
biscuits, Mis&#8217; Carr?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd was obliged to rise and reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
past Uncle Israel, who declined to be contaminated
by passing the plate, before she
attained her desired biscuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time, Aunt Belinda,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
throw you one. Suffering Moses, what new
dope is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>A powerful and peculiarly penetrating odour
filled the room. Presently it became evident
that Uncle Israel had uncorked a fresh bottle
of medicine. Miss St. Clair coughed and
hastily excused herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for me to take my pain-killer,&#8221;
murmured Uncle Israel, pouring out a tablespoonful
of a thick, brown mixture. &#8220;This
here cured a Congressman in less &#8217;n half a
bottle of a gnawin&#8217; pain in his vitals. I ain&#8217;t
never took none of it yet, but I aim to now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vapour of it had already made the
twins cry and brought tears to Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s
eyes, but Uncle Israel took it clear and
smacked his lips over it enjoyably. &#8220;It
seems to be a searchin&#8217; medicine,&#8221; he commented,
after an interval of silence. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
misdoubt that it&#8217;ll locate that pain that was
movin&#8217; up and down my back all night last
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel&#8217;s wizened old face, with its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
fringe of white whisker, beamed with the joy
of a scientist who has made a new and important
discovery. He had a long, hooked
nose, and was painfully near-sighted, but
refused to wear glasses. Just now he sniffed
inquiringly at the open bottle of medicine.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, nodding his bald head sagely,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t misdoubt this here can locate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, either,&#8221; said Harlan, grimly, putting
his handkerchief to his nose. &#8220;Will you
excuse me, Dorothy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes took the weeping twins away
from the table, and Willie, his mentor gone,
began to eat happily with his fingers. The
poet rose and drew a roll of manuscript from
his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon,&#8221; he said, clearing his
throat, &#8220;I employed my spare moments in
composing an ode to the memory of our
sainted relative, under whose hospitable roof
we are all now so pleasantly gathered. I will
read it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd hastily left the table, muttering
indistinctly, and Dick followed her. Willie
slipped from his chair, crawled under the
table, and by stealthily sticking a pin into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Uncle Israel&#8217;s ankle, produced a violent disturbance,
during which the pain-killer was
badly spilled. When the air finally cleared,
there was no one in the room but the poet,
who sadly rolled up his manuscript.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will read it at breakfast,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;I will give them all the pleasure of hearing
it. Art is for the many, not for the few. I
must use it to elevate humanity to the Ideal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back to his own room to add
some final reverent touches to the masterpiece,
and to meditate upon the delicate
blonde beauty of Miss St. Clair.</p>
<p>From Mrs. Dodd, meanwhile, Dick had
gathered the pleasing purport of her voluminous
correspondence, and insisted on posting
all the letters that very night, though morning
would have done just as well. When he had
gone downhill on his errand of mercy, whistling
cheerily as was his wont, Mrs. Dodd
went into her own room and locked the door,
immediately beginning a careful search of the
entire apartment.</p>
<p>She scrutinised the walls closely, and rapped
softly here and there, listening intently for a
hollow sound. Standing on a chair, she felt
all along the mouldings and window-casings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
taking unto herself much dust in the process.
She spent half an hour in the stuffy closet, investigating
the shelves and recesses, then she
got down on her rheumatic old knees and
crept laboriously over the carpet, systematically
taking it breadth by breadth, and paying
special attention to that section of it which
was under the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve found where anythin&#8217; ain&#8217;t,&#8221;
she said to herself, &#8220;you&#8217;ve gone a long way
toward findin&#8217; where &#8217;t is. It&#8217;s just like
Ebeneezer to have hid it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took down the pictures, which were
mainly family portraits, life-size, presented to
the master of the house by devoted relatives,
and rapidly unframed them. In one of them
she found a sealed envelope, which she eagerly
tore open. Inside was a personal communication
which, though brief, was very much
to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Cousin Belinda,&#8221; it read, &#8220;I hope
you&#8217;re taking pleasure in your hunt. I have
kept my word to you and in this very room,
somewhere, is a sum of money which represents
my estimate of your worth, as nearly as
sordid coin can hope to do. It is all in cash,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
for greater convenience in handling. I trust
you will not spend it all in one store, and
that you will, out of your abundance, be generous
to the poor. It might be well to use a
part of it in making a visit to New York.
When you find this, I shall be out in the
cemetery all by myself, and very comfortable.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;Yours, <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Ebeneezer Judson.&#8221;</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I knowed it,&#8221; she said to herself, excitedly.
&#8220;Ebeneezer was a hard man, but he always
kep&#8217; his word. Dear me! What makes me
so trembly!&#8221;</p>
<p>She removed all the bedclothes and pounded
the pillows and mattress in vain, then turned
her attention to the furniture. It was almost
one o&#8217;clock when Mrs. Dodd finally retired,
worn in body and jaded in spirit, but still far
from discouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ebeneezer must have mistook the room,&#8221;
she said to herself, &#8220;but how could he unless
his mind was failin&#8217;? I&#8217;ve had this now,
goin&#8217; on ten year.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the night she dreamed of finding money
in the bureau, and got up to see if by chance
she had not received mysterious guidance
from an unknown source. There was money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
in the bureau, sure enough, but it was only
two worn copper cents wrapped in many
thicknesses of old newspaper, and she went
unsuspiciously back to bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s mistook the room,&#8221; she breathed,
drowsily, as she sank into troubled slumber,
&#8220;an&#8217; to-morrer I&#8217;ll have it changed. It&#8217;s
just as well I&#8217;ve scared them others off, if so
be I have.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s Third Husband</h3>
</div>

<p>Insidiously, a single idea took possession
of the entire household. Mrs. Smithers
kept a spade near at hand and systematically
dug, as opportunity offered. Dorothy became
accustomed to an odorous lantern which stood
near the back door in the daytime and bobbed
about among the shrubbery at night.</p>
<p>There was definite method in the madness
of Mrs. Smithers, however, for she had once
seen the departed Mr. Judson going out to the
orchard with a tin box under his arm and her
own spade but partially concealed under his
long overcoat. When he came back, he was
smiling, which was so unusual that she forgot
all about the box, and did not observe whether
or not he had brought it back with him.
Long afterward, however, the incident assumed
greater significance.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d &#8217;ave &#8217;ad the sense to &#8217;ave gone out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
there the next day,&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;and &#8217;ave
seen where &#8217;e &#8217;ad dug, I might be a rich
woman now, that&#8217;s wot I might. &#8217;E was a
clever one, &#8217;e was, and &#8217;e&#8217;s &#8217;id it. The old
skinflint wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; no work, &#8217;e wasn&#8217;t,
and &#8217;e lived on &#8217;ere from year to year, a-payin&#8217;
&#8217;is bills like a Christian gent, and it stands to
reason there&#8217;s money &#8217;id somewheres. Findin&#8217;
is keepin&#8217;, and it&#8217;s for me to keep my &#8217;ead
shut and a sharp lookout. Them Carrs don&#8217;t
suspect nothink.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was only half right, however. Harlan,
lost in his book, was heedless of everything
that went on around him, but Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s
reference to the diamond pin, and her own
recollection of the money she had found in
the bureau drawer, began to work stealthily
upon Dorothy&#8217;s mind, surrounded, as she was,
by people who were continually thinking of
the same thing.</p>
<p>Then, too, their funds were getting low.
There was little to send to the sanitarium now,
for eleven people, as students of domestic
economics have often observed, eat more than
one or two. Dick was also affected by the
current financial depression, and at length
conceived the idea that Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
worldly goods were somewhere on the premises.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes spent a great deal of time in
the attic, while the care-free children, utterly
beyond control, rioted madly through the
house. Dorothy discovered Mr. Perkins, the
poet, half-way up the parlour chimney, and
sat down to see what he would do when he
came out and found her there. He had seemed
somewhat embarrassed when he wiped the
soot from his face, but had quickly explained
that he was writing a poem on chimney-swallows
and had come to a point where original
research was essential.</p>
<p>Even Elaine, not knowing what she sought,
began to investigate, idly enough, the furniture
and hangings in her room, and Mrs.
Dodd, eagerly seizing opportunities, was forever
keen on the scent. Uncle Israel, owing
to the poor state of his health, was one of the
last to be affected by the surrounding atmosphere,
but when he caught the idea, he made
up for lost time.</p>
<p>He was up with the chickens, and invariably
took a long afternoon nap, so that, during the
night, there was bound to be a wakeful interval.
Ordinarily, he took a sleeping potion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
to tide him over till morning, but soon decided
that a little mild exercise with some pleasant
purpose animating it, would be far better for
his nerves.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd was awakened one night by the
feeling that some one was in her room. A
vague, mysterious Presence gradually made
itself known. At first she was frightened,
then the Presence wheezed, and reassured
her. Across the path of moonlight that lay
on her floor, Uncle Israel moved cautiously.</p>
<p>He was clad in a piebald dressing-gown
which had been so patched with various materials
that the original fabric was uncertain.
An old-fashioned nightcap was on his head,
the tassel bobbing freakishly in the back, and
he wore carpet slippers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd sat up in bed, keenly relishing
the situation. When he opened a bureau
drawer, she screamed out: &#8220;What are you
looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel started violently. &#8220;Money,&#8221;
he answered, in a shrill whisper, taken altogether
by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, kindly, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
right up and help you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Belinda,&#8221; pleaded the old man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll wake up everybody. I am a-walkin&#8217;
in my sleep, I guess. I was a-dreamin&#8217; of
money that I was to find and give to
you, and I suppose that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve come
to your room. You lay still, Belinda, and
don&#8217;t tell nobody. I am a-goin&#8217; right
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before she could answer in a way that
seemed suitable, he was gone, and the next
day he renewed his explanations. &#8220;I dunno,
Belinda, how I ever come to be a-walkin&#8217; in
my sleep. I ain&#8217;t never done such a thing
since I was a child, and then only wunst.
How dretful it would have been if I had gone
into any other room and mebbe have been
shot or have scared some young and unprotected
female into fits. To think of me, with
my untarnished reputation, and at my age,
a-doin&#8217; such a thing! You don&#8217;t reckon it
was my new pain-killer, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t misdoubt it had sunthin&#8217; to do
with payin&#8217;,&#8221; returned Mrs. Dodd, greatly
pleased with her own poor joke, &#8220;an&#8217;, as you
say, it might have been dretful. But I am a
friend to you, Israel, an&#8217; I don&#8217;t &#8217;low to make
your misfortune public, but, by workin&#8217; private,
help you overcome it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What air you a-layin&#8217; out to do?&#8221; demanded
Uncle Israel, fearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t rightly made up my mind as yet,
Israel,&#8221; she answered, pleasantly enough,
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t intend to have it happen to you
again. Sunthin&#8217; can surely be done that&#8217;ll
cure you of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Belinda,&#8221; wheezed her victim; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever have it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret about it, Israel, &#8217;cause you
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have it no more. I&#8217;ll attend to
it. It &#8217;s a most distressin&#8217; disease an&#8217; must
be took early, but I think I know how to
fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>During her various investigations, she had
found a huge bunch of keys beneath a pile of
rubbish on the floor of a closet in an unoccupied
room. It was altogether possible, as she
told herself, that one of these keys should fit
the somnambulist&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>While Uncle Israel was brewing a fresh supply
of medicine on the kitchen stove, she
found, as she had suspected that one of them
did fit, and thereafter, every night, when
Uncle Israel had retired, she locked him in,
letting him out shortly after seven each morning.
When he remonstrated with her, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
replied, triumphantly, that it was necessary&mdash;otherwise
he would never have known that
the door was locked.</p>
<p>On her first visit to &#8220;town&#8221; she made it
her business to call upon Lawyer Bradford and
inquire as to Mr. Judson&#8217;s last will and testament.
She learned that it did not concern
her at all, and was to be probated, in accordance
with the dead man&#8217;s instructions, at the
Fall term of court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, as yet,&#8221; she said, with a gleam of
satisfaction in her small, beady eyes, &#8220;they
ain&#8217;t holdin&#8217; the house legal. Any of us has
the same right to stay as them Carrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as you look at it,&#8221; returned Mr.
Bradford, squirming uneasily in his chair.</p>
<p>Try as she might, she could extract no further
information, but she at least had a bit of
knowledge to work on. She went back,
earnestly desiring quiet, that she might study
the problem without hindrance, but, unfortunately
for her purpose, the interior of the
Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern resembled pandemonium let
loose.</p>
<p>Willie was sliding down the railing part
of the time, and at frequent intervals coasting
downstairs on Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s tea tray,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
vocally expressing his pleasure with each trip.
The twins, seated in front of the library door,
were pounding furiously on a milk-pan, which
had not been empty when they dragged it
into the hall, but was now. Mrs. Smithers
was singing: &#8220;We have our trials here below,
Oh, Glory, Hallelujah,&#8221; and a sickening
odour from a fresh concoction of Uncle Israel&#8217;s
permeated the premises. Having irreverently
detached the false front from the keys of the
melodeon, Mr. Perkins was playing a sad,
funereal composition of his own, with all the
power of the instrument turned loose on it.
Upstairs, Dick was whistling, with shrill and
maddening persistence, and Dorothy, quite
helpless, sat miserably on the porch with her
fingers in her ears.</p>
<p>Harlan burst out of the library, just as Mrs.
Dodd came up the walk, his temper not improved
by stumbling over the twins and the
milk-pan, and above their united wails loudly
censured Dorothy for the noise and confusion.
&#8220;How in the devil do you expect me to
work?&#8221; he demanded, irritably. &#8220;If you
can&#8217;t keep the house quiet, I&#8217;ll go back to
New York!&#8221;</p>
<p>Too crushed in spirit to reply, Dorothy said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
nothing, and Harlan whisked back into the
library again, barely escaping Mrs. Dodd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child,&#8221; she said to Dorothy; &#8220;you
look plum beat out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; confessed Mrs. Carr, the quick
tears coming to her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, my dear, rest easy. I reckon
this is the first time you&#8217;ve been married,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Dorothy, forcing a pitiful
little smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. Now, when you&#8217;re as
used to it as I be, you won&#8217;t take it so hard.
You may think men folks is all different, but
there&#8217;s a dretful sameness to &#8217;em after they&#8217;ve
been through a marriage ceremony. Marriage
is just like findin&#8217; a new penny on the
walk. When you first see it, it&#8217;s all shiny
an&#8217; a&#8217;most like gold, an&#8217; it tickles you a&#8217;most
to pieces to think you&#8217;re gettin&#8217; it, but after
you&#8217;ve picked it up you see that what you&#8217;ve
got is half wild Indian, or mebbe more&mdash;I
ain&#8217;t never been in no mint. You may depend
upon it, my dear, there&#8217;s two sides to
all of us, an&#8217; before marriage, you see the
wreath&mdash;afterwards a savage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had seven of &#8217;em,&#8221; she continued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
&#8220;an&#8217; I know. My father give me a cemetery
lot for a weddin&#8217; present, with a noble grey
marble monumint in it shaped like a octagon&mdash;leastways
that&#8217;s what a school-teacher what
boarded with us said it was, but I call it a
eight-sided piece. I&#8217;m speakin&#8217; of my first
marriage now, my dear. My father never
give me no weddin&#8217; present but the once. An&#8217;
I can&#8217;t never marry again, &#8217;cause there&#8217;s a
husband lyin&#8217; now on seven sides of the monumint
an&#8217; only one place left for me. I was
told once that I could have further husbands
cremationed an&#8217; set around the lot in vases,
but I don&#8217;t take to no such heathenish custom
as that.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve got to go through my declinin&#8217;
years without no suitable companion an&#8217; I
call it hard, when one&#8217;s so used to marryin&#8217;
as what I be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re all savages,&#8221; suggested Dorothy,
&#8220;why did you keep on marrying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I hadn&#8217;t no other way to get my
livin&#8217; an&#8217; I was kinder in the habit of it.
There&#8217;s some little variety, even in savages,
an&#8217; it&#8217;s human natur&#8217; to keep on a-hopin.&#8217;
I&#8217;ve had &#8217;em stingy an&#8217; generous, drunk an&#8217;
sober, peaceful an&#8217; disturbin&#8217;. After the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
few times, I learned to take real pleasure
out&#8217;n their queer notions. When you&#8217;ve
learned to enjoy seein&#8217; your husband make a
fool of himself an&#8217; have got enough self-control
not to tell him he&#8217;s doin&#8217; it, nor to let him see
where your pleasure lies, you&#8217;ve got marryin&#8217;
down to a fine point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third time, it was, I got a food
crank, an&#8217; let me tell you right now, my
dear, them&#8217;s the worst kind. A man what&#8217;s
queer about his food is goin&#8217; to be queerer
about a&#8217;most everything else. Give me any
man that can eat three square meals a day an&#8217;
enjoy &#8217;em, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll undertake to live with him
peaceful, but I don&#8217;t go to the altar again with
no food crank, if I know it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was partly my own fault, too, as I see
later. I&#8217;d seen him a-carryin&#8217; a passel of
health food around in his pocket an&#8217; a-nibblin&#8217;
at it, but I supposed it was because the poor
creeter had never had no one to cook proper
for him, an&#8217; I took a lot of pleasure out of
thinkin&#8217; how tickled he&#8217;d be when I made
him one of my chicken pies.</p>
<p>&#8220;After we was married, we took a honeymoon
to his folks, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll tell you right now,
my dear, that if there was more honeymoons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
took beforehand to each other&#8217;s folks, there&#8217;d
be less marryin&#8217; done than what there is.
They was all a-eatin&#8217; hay an&#8217; straw an&#8217; oats just
like the dumb creeters they disdained, an&#8217; a-carryin&#8217;
wheat an&#8217; corn around in their pockets
to piece out with between greens.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the day we got home, never knowin&#8217;
what I was a-stirrin&#8217; up for myself, I turned
in an&#8217; made a chicken an&#8217; oyster pie, an&#8217; it
couldn&#8217;t be beat, not if I do say it as shouldn&#8217;t.
The crust was as soft an&#8217; flaky an&#8217; brown an&#8217;
crisp at the edges as any I ever turned out, an&#8217;
the inside was all chicken an&#8217; oysters well-nigh
smothered in a thick, creamy yellow
gravy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, I brung in that pie, an&#8217; I set it
on the table, an&#8217; I chirped out that dinner was
ready, an&#8217; he come, an&#8217;&mdash;my dear! You
never saw such goins&#8217;-on in all your born
days! Considerin&#8217; that not eatin&#8217; animals
makes people&#8217;s dispositions mild an&#8217; pleasant,
it was sunthin&#8217; terrible, an&#8217; me all the time as
innercent as a lamb!</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t begin to tell you the things my
new-made husband said to me. If chickens
an&#8217; oysters was human, I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;d have
sued him for slander. He said that oysters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
was &#8216;the scavengers of the sea&#8217;&mdash;yes&#8217;m,
them&#8217;s his very words, an&#8217; that chickens was
even worse. He went on to tell me how
they et worms an&#8217; potato bugs an&#8217; beetles an&#8217;
goodness knows what else, an&#8217; that he wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to turn the temple of his body into no
slaughter-house. He asked me if I desired to
eat dead animals, an&#8217; when he insisted on an
answer, I told him I certainly shouldn&#8217;t care
to eat &#8217;em less&#8217;n they <i>was</i> dead, and from
then on it was worse &#8217;n ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that no dead animal was goin&#8217; to
be interred in the insides of him or his lawful
wife, an&#8217; he was goin&#8217; to see to it. It come
out then that he&#8217;d never tasted meat an&#8217;
hadn&#8217;t rightly sensed what he was missin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, some women would have
took the wrong tack an&#8217; would have argyfied
with him. There&#8217;s never no use in argyfyin&#8217;
with a husband, an&#8217; never no need to, &#8217;cause
if you&#8217;re set on it, there&#8217;s all the rest of the
world to choose from. When he&#8217;d talked
himself hoarse an&#8217; was beginnin&#8217; to calm
down again, I took the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Say no more,&#8217; says I, calm an&#8217; collected-like.
&#8216;This here is your house an&#8217; the things
you&#8217;re accustomed to eatin&#8217; can be cooked in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
it, no matter what they be. If I don&#8217;t know
how to put the slops together, I reckon I can
learn, not being a plum idjit. If you want
baked chicken feed and boiled hay, I&#8217;m here
to bake &#8217;em and boil &#8217;em for you. All you
have to do is to speak once in a polite manner
and it&#8217;ll be done. I must insist on the politeness,
howsumever,&#8217; says I. &#8216;I don&#8217;t propose to
live with any man what gets the notion a
woman ceases to be a lady when she marries
him. A creeter that thinks so poor of himself
as that ain&#8217;t fit to be my husband,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;nor no other decent woman&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that he apologised some, an&#8217; when a
husband apologises, my dear, it&#8217;s the same as
if he&#8217;d et dirt at your feet. &#8216;The least said
the soonest mended,&#8217; says I, an&#8217; after that, he
never had nothin&#8217; to complain of.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I knowed what his poor, cranky system
needed, an&#8217; I knowed how to get it into
him, especially as he&#8217;d never tasted meat in
all his life. From that time on, he never saw
no meat on our table, nor no chickens, nor
sea scavengers, nor nothin&#8217;, but all day,
while he was gone, I was busy with my soup
pot, a-makin&#8217; condensed extracts of meat for
flavourin&#8217; vegetables an&#8217; sauces an&#8217; so on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He took mightily to my cookin&#8217; an&#8217; frequently
said he&#8217;d never et such exquisite victuals.
I&#8217;d make cream soups for him, an&#8217; in
every one, there&#8217;d be over a cupful of solid
meat jelly, as rich as the juice you find in the
pan when you cook a first-class roast of beef.
I&#8217;d stew potatoes in veal stock, and cook rice
slow in water that had had a chicken boiled
to rags in it. Once I put a cupful of raw
beef juice in a can of tomatoes I was cookin&#8217;
and he et a&#8217;most all of &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8220;As he kep&#8217; on havin&#8217; more confidence in
me, I kep&#8217; on usin&#8217; more an&#8217; more, an&#8217; a-usin&#8217;
oyster liquor for flavourin&#8217; in most everything
durin&#8217; the R months. Once he found nearly
a bushel of clam-shells out behind the house
an&#8217; wanted to know what they was an&#8217; what
they was doin&#8217; there. I told him the fish
man had give &#8217;em to me for a border for my
flower beds, which was true. I&#8217;d only paid
for the clams&mdash;there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nothin&#8217; said about
the shells&mdash;an&#8217; the juice from them clams
livened up his soup an&#8217; vegetables for over a
week. There wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no day that he didn&#8217;t
have the vital elements of from one to four
pounds of meat put in his food, an&#8217; all the
time, he was gettin&#8217; happier an&#8217; healthier an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
more peaceful to live with. When he died,
he was as mild as a spring lamb with mint
sauce on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my dear, some women would have
told him what they was doin&#8217;, either after he
got to likin&#8217; the cookin&#8217; or when he was on
his death-bed an&#8217; couldn&#8217;t help himself, but I
never did. I own that it took self-control
not to do it, but I&#8217;d learned my lesson from
havin&#8217; been married twicet before an&#8217; never
havin&#8217; fit any to speak of. I had to take my
pleasure from seein&#8217; him eat a bowl of rice
that had a whole chicken in it, exceptin&#8217; only
the bones and fibres of its mortal frame, an&#8217; a-lappin&#8217;
up mebbe a pint of tomato soup that
was founded on eight nice pork chops. I&#8217;m
a-tellin&#8217; you all this merely to show you my
point. Every day, Henry was makin&#8217; a blame
fool of himself without knowin&#8217; it. He&#8217;d
prattle by the hour of slaughter-houses an&#8217;
human cemeteries an&#8217; all the time he&#8217;d be
honin&#8217; for his next meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;He used to say as how it was dretful
wicked to kill the dumb animals for food, an&#8217; I
allers said that there was nothin&#8217; to hinder his
buyin&#8217; as many as he could afford to an&#8217; savin&#8217;
their lives by pennin&#8217; &#8217;em up in the back yard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
an&#8217; a-feedin&#8217; &#8217;em the things they liked best to
eat till they died of old age or sunthin&#8217;. I
told him they was all vegetarians, the same as
he was, an&#8217; they could live together peaceful
an&#8217; happy. I even pointed out that it was his
duty to do it, an&#8217; that if all believers would do
the same, the dread slaughter-houses would
soon be a thing of the past, but I ain&#8217;t never
seen no food crank yet that&#8217;s advanced that
far in his humanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never told him a single word about it,
nor even hinted it to him, nor told nobody
else, though I often felt wicked to think I was
keepin&#8217; so much pleasure to myself, but my
time is comin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m dead an&#8217; have gone to heaven,
the first thing I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do is to hunt up
Henry. They say there ain&#8217;t no marriage nor
givin&#8217; in marriage up there, but I reckon there&#8217;s
seven men there that&#8217;ll at least recognise their
wife when they see her a-comin&#8217; in. I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to pick up my skirts an&#8217; take off my glasses,
so&#8217;s I&#8217;ll be all ready to skedaddle, for I expect
to leave my rheumatiz behind me, my dear,
when I go to heaven&mdash;leastways, no place
will be heaven for me that&#8217;s got rheumatiz in
it&mdash;an&#8217; then I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to say: &#8216;Henry, in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the four years you was livin&#8217; with me, you
was eatin&#8217; meat, an&#8217; you never knowed it.
You&#8217;re nothin&#8217; but a human cemetery.&#8217; Oh,
my dear, it&#8217;s worth while dyin&#8217; when you
know you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to have pleasure like that
at the other end!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>Her Gift to the World</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I regret, my dear madam,&#8221; said Lawyer
Bradford, twisting uneasily in his chair,
&#8220;that I can offer you no encouragement
whatsoever. The will is clear and explicit in
every detail, and there are no grounds for a
contest. I am, perhaps, trespassing upon the
wishes of my client in giving you this information,
but if you are remaining here with
the hope of pecuniary profit, you are remaining
here unnecessarily.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose as though to indicate that the interview
was at an end, but Mrs. Holmes was
not to be put away in that fashion. Her eyes
were blazing and her weak chin trembled
with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me,&#8221; she demanded,
&#8220;that Ebeneezer voluntarily died without
making some sort of provision for me and
my helpless little children?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your distinguished relation,&#8221; answered
Mr. Bradford, slowly, &#8220;certainly died voluntarily.
He announced the date of his death
some weeks before it actually occurred, and
superintended the making of his own coffin.
He wrote out minute directions for his obsequies,
had his grave dug, and his shroud
made, burned his papers, rearranged his
books, made his will&mdash;and was found dead
in his bed on the morning of the day set for
his departure. A methodical person,&#8221; muttered
the old man, half to himself; &#8220;a most
methodical and systematic person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes shuddered. She was not ordinarily
a superstitious woman, but there was
something uncanny in this open partnership
with Death.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a diamond pin,&#8221; she suggested,
moodily, &#8220;worth, I should think,
some fifteen or sixteen hundred dollars.
Ebeneezer gave it to dear Rebecca on their
wedding day, and she always said it was
to be mine. Have you any idea where
it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Bradford fidgeted. &#8220;If it was intended
for you,&#8221; he said, finally, &#8220;it will be given
to you at the proper time, or you will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
directed to its location. Mrs. Judson died,
did she not, about three weeks after their
marriage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Holmes, readily perceiving
the line of his thought, &#8220;and I saw
her twice in those three weeks. Both times
she spoke of the pin, which she wore constantly,
and said that if anything happened to
her, she wanted me to have it, but that old
miser hung on to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said Mr. Bradford, a faint flush
mounting to his temples as he opened the
office door, &#8220;you are speaking of my Colonel,
under whom I served in the war. He was
my best friend, and though he is dead, it is
still my privilege to protect him. I bid you
good afternoon!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not perceive until long afterward
that she had practically been ejected from the
legal presence. Even then, she was so intent
upon the point at issue that she was not
offended, as at another time she certainly
would have been.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s lying,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;they&#8217;re
all lying. There&#8217;s money hidden in that
house, and I know it, and what&#8217;s more, I&#8217;m
going to have it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>She had searched her own rooms on the
night of her arrival, but found nothing, and
the attic, so far, had yielded her naught save
discouragement and dust. &#8220;To think,&#8221; she
continued, mentally, &#8220;that after two of my
children were born here and named for them,
that we are left in this way! I call it a shame,
a disgrace, an outrage!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her anger swiftly cooled, however, as she
went into the house, and her fond sight rested
upon her darlings. Willie had a ball and had
already broken two of the front windows.
The small Rebecca was under the sofa, tempering
the pleasure of life for Claudius Tiberius,
while young Ebeneezer, having found a
knife somewhere, was diligently scratching
the melodeon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look,&#8221; said Mrs. Holmes, in delighted
awe, as Dorothy entered the room. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
make any noise, or you will disturb Ebbie.
He is such a sensitive child that the sound of
a strange voice will upset him. Did you ever
see anything like those figures he is drawing
on the melodeon? I believe he&#8217;s going to be
an artist!&#8221;</p>
<p>Crushed as she was in spirit by her uncongenial
surroundings, Dorothy still had enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
temper left to be furiously angry. In these
latter days, however, she had gained largely
in self-control, and now only bit her lips
without answering.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Holmes would not have heard
her, even if she had replied. A sudden yowl
from the distressed Claudius impelled Dorothy
to move the sofa and rescue him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How cruel you are!&#8221; commented Mrs.
Holmes. &#8220;The idea of taking Rebbie&#8217;s plaything
away from her! Give it back this
instant!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr put the cat out and returned with
a defiant expression on her face, which roused
Mrs. Holmes to action. &#8220;Willie,&#8221; she commanded,
&#8220;go out and get the kitty for your
little sister. There, there, Rebbie, darling,
don&#8217;t cry any more! Brother has gone to get
the kitty. Don&#8217;t cry!&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8220;brother&#8221; had not gone. &#8220;Chase it
yourself,&#8221; he remarked, coolly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
out to the barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Willie&#8217;s individuality is developing
every day,&#8221; Mrs. Holmes went on, smoothly.
&#8220;There, there, Rebbie, don&#8217;t cry any more.
Go and tell Mrs. Smithers to give you a big
piece of bread with lots of butter and jam on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
it. Tell her mamma said so. Run along,
that&#8217;s a nice little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rude squares, triangles, and circles appeared
as by magic on the shining surface
of the melodeon, the young artist being not
at all disturbed by the confusion about
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am blessed in my children,&#8221; Mrs.
Holmes went on, happily. &#8220;I often wonder
what I have done that I should have so perfect
a boy as Willie for my very own. Everybody
admires him so that I dwell in constant
fear of kidnappers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Dorothy, with
ill-concealed sarcasm. &#8220;Anybody who took
him would bring him back inside of two
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I try to think so,&#8221; returned the mother,
with a deep sigh. &#8220;Willie&#8217;s indomitable
will is my deepest comfort. He gets it from
my side of the family. None of the children
take after their father at all. Ebbie was a
little like his father&#8217;s folks at first, but I soon
got it out of him and made him altogether
like my people. I do not think anybody
could keep Willie away from me except by
superior physical force. He absolutely adores
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
his mother, as my other children do. You
never saw such beautiful sentiment as they
have. The other day, now, when I went
away and left Rebbie alone in my apartment,
she took down my best hat and put it on.
The poor little thing wanted to be near her
mother. Is it not touching?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is indeed,&#8221; Dorothy assented, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My children have never been punished,&#8221;
continued Mrs. Holmes, now auspiciously
launched upon her favourite theme. &#8220;It has
never been necessary. I rule them entirely
through love, and they are so accustomed to
my methods that they bitterly resent any interference
by outsiders. Why, just before we
came here, Ebbie, young as he is, put out the
left eye of a woman who tried to take his dog
away from him. He did it with his little fist
and with apparently no effort at all. Is it not
wonderful to see such strength and power of
direction in one so young? The woman was
in the hospital when we came away, and I
trust by this time, she has learned not to interfere
with Ebbie. No one is allowed to
interfere with my children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently not,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Carr,
somewhat cynically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is beautiful to be a mother&mdash;the most
beautiful thing on earth! Just think how
much I have done for the world!&#8221; Her sallow
face glowed with the conscious virtue bestowed
by one of the animal functions upon
those who have performed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; queried Mrs. Carr, wholly
missing the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, in raising Willie and Ebbie and
Rebbie! No public service can for a moment
be compared with that! All other things sink
into insignificance beside the glorious gift of
maternity. Look at Willie&mdash;a form that a
sculptor might dream of for a lifetime and
never hope to imitate&mdash;a head that already has
inspired great artists! The gentleman who
took Willie&#8217;s last tintype said that he had
never seen such perfect lines, and insisted on
taking several for fear something should happen
to Willie. He wanted to keep some of
them for himself&mdash;it was pathetic, the way he
pleaded, but I made him sell me all of them.
Willie is mine and I have the first right to his
tintypes. And a lady once painted Willie at
his play in black and white and sent it to one
of the popular weeklies. I have no doubt
they gave her a fortune for it, but it never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
occurred to her to give us anything more than
one copy of the paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which paper was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the so-called comic weeklies.
You know they publish superb artistic things.
I think they are doing a wonderful work in
educating the masses to a true appreciation of
art. One of the wonderful parts of it was
that Willie knew all about it and was not in
the least conceited. Any other child would
have been set up at being a model for a great
artist, but Willie was not affected at all. He
has so much character!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point the small Rebecca entered,
dragging her doll by one arm, and munching
a thick slice of bread, thinly coated with
molasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I distinctly said jam,&#8221; remarked Mrs.
Holmes. &#8220;Servants are so heedless. I do
not know that molasses is good for Rebbie.
What would you think, Mrs. Carr?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will hurt her if she doesn&#8217;t
get too much of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger of her getting too
much of it. Mrs. Smithers is too stingy for
that. Why, only yesterday, Willie told me
that she refused to let him dip his dry bread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
in the cream, and gave him a cup of plain
milk instead. Willie knows when his system
needs cream and I want him to have all the
nourishment he can get. The idea that she
should think she knew more about it than
Willie! She was properly punished for it,
however. I myself saw Willie throw a stick
of stove wood at her and hit her foolish head
with it. I think Willie is going to be a soldier,
a commander of an army. He has so
much executive ability and never misses what
he aims at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rebbie, don&#8217;t chew on that side, darling;
remember your loose tooth is there. Mamma
doesn&#8217;t want it to come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Dorothy, with a gleam of
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t bear to have her little baby
teeth come out and make her grow up! I
want to keep her just as she is. I have all my
children&#8217;s teeth, and some day I am going to
have them set into a beautiful bracelet. Look
at that! How generous and unselfish of
Rebbie! She is trying to share her bread
with her doll. I believe Rebbie is going to
be a philanthropist, or a college-settlement
worker. See, she is trying to give the doll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
the molasses&mdash;the very best part of it. Did
you ever see such a beautiful spirit in one so
young?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Carr could answer, young
Ebeneezer had finished his wood carving and
had grabbed his protesting twin by the hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, Rebbie,&#8221; soothed the mother,
&#8220;don&#8217;t cry. Brother was only loving little
sister. Be careful, Ebbie. You can take hold
of sister&#8217;s hair, but not too hard. They love
each other so,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Ebbie is
really sentimental about Rebbie. He loves to
touch and stroke her glorious blonde hair.
Did you ever see such hair as Rebbie&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>It came into Mrs. Carr&#8217;s mind that &#8220;Rebbie&#8217;s&#8221;
hair looked more like a plate of cold-slaw than
anything else, but she was too wise to put
the thought into words.</p>
<p>Willie slid down the railing and landed in
the hall with a loud whoop of glee. &#8220;How
beautiful to hear the sounds of childish mirth,&#8221;
said Mrs. Holmes. &#8220;How&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>From upstairs came a cry of &#8220;Help! Help!&#8221;</p>
<p>Muffled though the voice was, it plainly
issued from Uncle Israel&#8217;s room, and under
the impression that the bath cabinet had
finally set the house on fire, Mrs. Carr ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
hastily upstairs, followed closely by Mrs.
Holmes, who was flanked at the rear by the
grinning Willie and the interested twins.</p>
<p>From a confused heap of bedding, Uncle
Israel&#8217;s scarlet ankles waved frantically. &#8220;Help!
Help!&#8221; he cried again, his voice being almost
wholly deadened by the pillows, which had
fallen on him after the collapse.</p>
<p>Dorothy helped the trembling old man to
his feet. He took a copious draught from the
pain-killer, then sat down on his trunk, much
perturbed.</p>
<p>Investigation proved that the bed cord had
been cut in a dozen places by some one working
underneath, and that the entire structure
had instantly caved in when Uncle Israel had
crept up to the summit of his bed and lain
down to take his afternoon nap. When questioned,
Willie proudly admitted that he had
done it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go down and ask Mrs. Smithers for the
clothes-line,&#8221; commanded Dorothy, sternly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Willie, smartly, putting his
hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better go yourself, Mrs. Carr,&#8221;
suggested Mrs. Holmes. &#8220;Willie is tired.
He has played hard all day and needs rest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
He must not on any account over-exert himself,
and, besides, I never allow any one else
to send my children on errands. They obey
me and me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go yourself,&#8221; said Willie, having gathered
encouragement from the maternal source.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; wheezed Uncle Israel. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
sleep in no other bed. Ebeneezer&#8217;s beds is
all terrible drafty, and I took two colds at
once sleepin&#8217; in one of &#8217;em when I knowed
better &#8217;n to try it.&#8221; He tottered out of the
room, the very picture of wretchedness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it not clever of Willie?&#8221; whispered
Mrs. Holmes, admiringly, to Dorothy. &#8220;So
much ingenuity&mdash;such a fine sense of humor!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were my child,&#8221; snapped Dorothy,
at last losing her admirable control of a tempestuous
temper, &#8220;he&#8217;d be soundly thrashed
at least three times a week!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not doubt it,&#8221; replied Mrs. Holmes,
contemptuously. &#8220;These married old maids,
who have no children of their own, are always
wholly out of sympathy with a child&#8217;s
nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was young,&#8221; retorted Mrs. Carr,
&#8220;children were not allowed to rule the entire
household. There was a current superstition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
to the effect that older people had some
rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; Mrs. Holmes continued, meditatively,
&#8220;as the editor of <i>The Ladies&#8217; Own</i>
so pertinently asks, what is a house for if
not to bring up a child in? The purpose of
architecture is defeated, where there are no
children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel, accompanied by Dick, hobbled
into the room with the clothes-line. Mrs.
Holmes discreetly retired, followed by her
offspring, and, late in the afternoon, when
Dorothy and Dick were well-nigh fagged out,
the structure was in place again. Tremulously
the exhausted owner lay down upon
it, and asked that his supper be sent to his
room.</p>
<p>By skilful man&oelig;uvring with Mrs. Smithers,
Dick compelled the proud-spirited Willie
to take up Uncle Israel&#8217;s tray and wait for it.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell my mother,&#8221; whimpered the sorrowful
one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will,&#8221; replied Dick, significantly;
but for some reason of his own, Willie
neglected to mention it.</p>
<p>At dinner-time, Mr. Perkins drew a rolled
manuscript, tied with a black ribbon, from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
breast pocket, and, without preliminary, proceeded
to read as follows:</p>

<p>When he had finished, there was a solemn
silence, which was at last relieved by Mrs.
Dodd. &#8220;Poetry broke out in my first husband&#8217;s
family,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but with sulphur
an&#8217; molasses an&#8217; quinine an&#8217; plenty of wet-sheet
packs it was finally cured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not understand,&#8221; said the poet,
indulgently. &#8220;Your aura is not harmonious
with mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your&mdash;what?&#8221; demanded Mrs. Dodd,
pricking up her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aura,&#8221; explained Mr. Perkins, flushing
faintly. &#8220;Each individuality gives out a
spiritual vapour, like a cloud, which surrounds
one. These are all in different colours,
and the colours change with the thoughts we
think. Black and purple are the gloomy,
morose colours; deep blue and the paler shades
show a sombre outlook on life; green is more
cheerful, though still serious; yellow and
orange show ambition and envy, and red and
white are emblematic of all the virtues&mdash;red
of the noble, martial qualities of man and
white of the angelic disposition of woman,&#8221;
he concluded, with a meaning glance at
Elaine, who had been much interested all
along.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What perfectly lovely ideas,&#8221; she said, in
a tone which made Dick&#8217;s blood boil. &#8220;Are
they original with you, Mr. Perkins?&#8221;</p>
<p>The poet cleared his throat. &#8220;I cannot
say that they are wholly original with me,&#8221;
he admitted, reluctantly, &#8220;though of course I
have modified and amplified them to accord
with my own individuality. They are doing
wonderful things now in the psychological
laboratories. They have a system of tubes so
finely constructed that by breathing into one
of them a person&#8217;s mental state is actually
expressed. An angry person, breathing into
one of these finely organised tubes, makes a
decided change in the colour of the vapour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; snorted Mrs. Dodd, pushing
back her chair briskly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been married
seven times, an&#8217; I never had to breathe into
no tube to let any of my husbands know
when I was mad!&#8221;</p>
<p>The poet crimsoned, but otherwise ignored
the comment. &#8220;If you will come into the
parlour just as twilight is falling,&#8221; he said to
the others, &#8220;I will gladly recite my ode on
Spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Subdued thanks came from the company,
though Harlan excused himself on the score
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
of his work, and Mrs. Holmes was obliged to
put the twins to bed. When twilight fell, no
one was at the rendezvous but Elaine and the
poet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just as well,&#8221; he said, in a low tone.
&#8220;There are several under dear Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
roof who are afflicted with an inharmonious
aura. With yours only am I in full
accord. It is a great pleasure to an artist to
feel such beautiful sympathy with his work.
Shall I say it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will,&#8221; murmured Elaine, deeply
honoured by acquaintance with a real poet.</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins drew his chair close to hers,
leaned over with an air of loving confidence,
and began:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Spring, oh Spring, dear, gentle Spring,</p>

<p>Elaine screamed, and in a twinkling was on
her chair with her skirts gathered about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
It was only Claudius Tiberius, dressed in Rebecca&#8217;s
doll&#8217;s clothes, scooting madly toward

break up the entertainment.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>A Sensitive Soul</h3>
</div>

<p>Uncle Israel was securely locked in
for the night, and was correspondingly
restless. He felt like a caged animal, and
sleep, though earnestly wooed, failed to come
to his relief. A powerful draught of his usual
sleeping potion had been like so much water,
as far as effect was concerned.</p>
<p>At length he got up, his lifelong habit of
cautious movement asserting itself even here,
and with tremulous, withered hands, lighted
his candle. Then he put on his piebald dressing-gown
and his carpet slippers, and sat on
the declivity of his bed, blinking at the light,
as wide awake as any owl.</p>
<p>Presently it came to him that he had not as
yet made a thorough search of his own apartment,
so he began at the foundation, so to
speak, and crawled painfully over the carpet,
paying special attention to the edges. Next,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
he fingered the baseboards carefully, rapping
here and there, as though he expected some
significant sound to penetrate his deafness.
Rising, he went over the wall systematically,
and at length, with the aid of a chair,
reached up to the picture-moulding. He had
gone nearly around the room, without any
definite idea of what he was searching for,
when his questioning fingers touched a small,
metallic object.</p>
<p>A smile of childlike pleasure transfigured
Uncle Israel&#8217;s wizened old face. Trembling,
he slipped down from the chair, falling over
the bath cabinet in his descent, and tried the
key in the lock. It fitted, and the old man
fairly chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I tell Belinda,&#8221; he muttered,
delightedly. Then a crafty second thought
suggested that it might be wiser to keep
&#8220;Belinda&#8221; in the dark, lest she might in some
way gain possession of the duplicate key.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but how I pity them
husbands of her&#8217;n. Bet their graves felt good
when they got into &#8217;em, the hull seven graves.
What with sneerin&#8217; at medicines and things a
person eats, it must have been awful, not to
mention stealin&#8217; of keys and a-lockin&#8217; &#8217;em
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
in nights. S&#8217;pose the house had got afire,
where&#8217;d I be now?&#8221; Grasping his treasure
closely, Uncle Israel blew out his candle and
tottered to bed, thereafter sleeping the sleep
of the just.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd detected subdued animation in
his demeanour when he appeared at breakfast
the following morning, and wondered what
had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look &#8217;s if sunthin&#8217; pleasant had happened,
Israel,&#8221; she began in a sprightly
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sunthin&#8217; pleasant has happened,&#8221; he returned,
applying himself to his imitation coffee
with renewed vigour. &#8220;I disremember
when I&#8217;ve felt so good about anythin&#8217; before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something pleasant happens every day,&#8221;
put in Elaine. The country air had made
roses bloom on her pale cheeks. Her blue
eyes had new light in them, and her golden
hair fairly shone. She was far more beautiful
than the sad, frail young woman who had
come to the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern not so many
weeks before.</p>
<p>&#8220;How optimistic you are!&#8221; sighed Mr.
Perkins, who was eating Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s crisp,
hot rolls with a very unpoetic appetite. &#8220;To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
me, the world grows worse every day. It is
only a few noble souls devoted to the Ideal
and holding their heads steadfastly above the
mire of commercialism that keep our so-called
civilisation from becoming an absolute hotbed
of greed&mdash;yes, a hotbed of greed,&#8221; he repeated,
the words sounding unexpectedly well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your aura seems to have a purple tinge
this morning,&#8221; commented Dorothy, slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a aura, ma?&#8221; demanded Willie,
with an unusual thirst for knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something that goes with a soft person,
Willie, dear,&#8221; responded Mrs. Holmes, quite
audibly. &#8220;You know there are some people
who have no backbone at all, like the jelly-fish
we saw at the seashore the year before dear
papa died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve knowed folks,&#8221; continued Mrs. Dodd,
taking up the wandering thread of the discourse,
&#8220;what was so soft when they was
little that their mas had to carry &#8217;em around
in a pail for fear they&#8217;d slop over and spile
the carpet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And when they grew up, too,&#8221; Dick
ventured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people,&#8221; said Harlan, in a polite attempt
to change the conversation, &#8220;never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
grow up at all. Their minds remain at a fixed
point. We all know them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; sighed Mrs. Dodd, looking straight
at the poet, &#8220;we all know them.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture the sensitive Mr. Perkins
rose and begged to be excused. It was the
small Ebeneezer who observed that he took a
buttered roll with him, and gratuitously gave
the information to the rest of the company.</p>
<p>Elaine flushed painfully, and presently excused
herself, following the crestfallen Mr.
Perkins to the orchard, where, entirely unsuspected
by the others, they had a trysting-place.
At intervals, they met, safely screened
by the friendly trees, and communed upon
the old, idyllic subject of poetry, especially as
represented by the unpublished works of
Harold Vernon Perkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you, Mr. Perkins,&#8221; Elaine began,
&#8220;how deeply I appreciate your fine, uncommercial
attitude. As you say, the world
is sordid, and it needs men like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soulful one ran his long, bony fingers
through his mane of auburn hair, and assented
with a pleased grunt. &#8220;There are few, Miss
St. Clair,&#8221; he said, &#8220;who have your fine discernment.
It is almost ideal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yet it seems too bad,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;that
the world-wide appreciation of your artistic
devotion should not take some tangible form.
Dollars may be vulgar and sordid, as you say,
but still, in our primitive era, they are our
only expression of value. I have even heard
it said,&#8221; she went on, rapidly, &#8220;that the
amount of wealth honestly acquired by any
individual was, after all, only the measure of
his usefulness to his race.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss St. Clair!&#8221; exclaimed the poet, deeply
shocked; &#8220;do I understand that you are actually
advising me to sell a poem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from it, Mr. Perkins,&#8221; Elaine reassured
him. &#8220;I was only thinking that by having
your work printed in a volume, or perhaps in
the pages of a magazine, you could reach a
wider audience, and thus accomplish your
ideal of uplifting the multitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am pained,&#8221; breathed the poet; &#8220;inexpressibly
pained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am sorry,&#8221; answered Elaine. &#8220;I
was only trying to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; continued Mr. Perkins, bitterly,
&#8220;of the soiled fingers of a labouring
man, a printer, actually touching these fancies
that even I hesitate to pen! Once I saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
fair white page of a book that had been
through that painful experience. You never
would have known it, my dear Miss St. Clair&mdash;it
was actually filthy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; murmured Elaine, duly impressed,
&#8220;but are there not more favourable conditions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought there might be,&#8221; returned
the poet, after a significant silence, &#8220;indeed,
I have prayed there might be. In some little
nook among the pines, where the brook for
ever sings and the petals of the apple blossoms
glide away to fairyland upon its shining surface,
while butterflies float lazily here and
there, if reverent hands might put the flowering
of my genius into a modest little book&mdash;I
should be tempted, yes, sorely tempted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mr. Perkins,&#8221; cried Elaine, ecstatically
clapping her hands, &#8220;how perfectly glorious
that would be! To think how much
sweetness and beauty would go into the book,
if that were done!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Additionally,&#8221; corrected Mr. Perkins, with
a slight flush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course I mean additionally. One
could smell the apple blossoms through the
printed page. Oh, Mr. Perkins, if I only had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
the means, how gladly would I devote my all
to this wonderful, uplifting work!&#8221;</p>
<p>The poet glanced around furtively, then
drew closer to Elaine. &#8220;I may tell you,&#8221; he
murmured, &#8220;in strict confidence, something
which my lips have never breathed before,
with the assurance that it will be as though
unsaid, may I not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed you may!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; whispered Mr. Perkins, &#8220;I am
living in that hope. My dear Uncle Ebeneezer,
though now departed, was a distinguished
patron of the arts. Many a time have I read
him my work, assured of his deep, though unexpressed
sympathy, and, lulled by the rhythm
of our spoken speech, he has passed without
a jar from my dreamland to his own. I know
he would never speak of it to any one&mdash;dear
Uncle Ebeneezer was too finely grained for
that&mdash;but still I feel assured that somewhere
within the walls of that sorely afflicted house,
a sum of&mdash;of money&mdash;has been placed, in
the hope that I might find it and carry out this
beautiful work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you hunted?&#8221; demanded Elaine, her
eyes wide with wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not hunted. I beg you, do not use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
so coarse a word. It jars upon my poet&#8217;s
soul with almost physical pain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; returned Elaine,
&#8220;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes,&#8221; interrupted the poet, in a
low tone, &#8220;when I have felt especially near
to Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s spirit, I have barely
glanced in secret places where I have felt he
might expect me to look for it, but, so far, I
have been wholly unsuccessful, though I know
that I plainly read his thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some word&mdash;some clue&mdash;did he give you
none?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None whatever, except that once or twice
he said that he would see that I was suitably
provided for. He intimated that he intended
me to have a sum apportioned to my deserts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which would be a generous one; but
now&mdash;Oh, Mr. Perkins, how can I help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have never suspected, have you,&#8221;
asked Mr. Perkins, colouring to his temples,
&#8220;that the room you now occupy might once
have been my own? Have no poet&#8217;s dreams,
lingering in the untenanted spaces, claimed
your beauteous spirit in sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Perkins, have I your room? I
will so gladly give it up&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>The poet raised his hand. &#8220;No. The place
where you have walked is holy ground. Not
for the world would I dispossess you, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A meaning look did the rest. &#8220;I see,&#8221; said
Elaine, quickly guessing his thought, &#8220;you
want to hunt in my room. Oh, Mr. Perkins,
I have thoughtlessly pained you again. Can
you ever forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My thoughts,&#8221; breathed Mr. Perkins, &#8220;are
perhaps too finely phrased for modern speech.
I would not trespass upon the place you have
made your own, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, then Elaine understood.
&#8220;I see,&#8221; she said, submissively, &#8220;I will
hunt myself. I mean, I will glance about in the
hope that the spirit of Uncle Ebeneezer may
make plain to me what you seek. And&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; interjected the poet, quite practical
for the moment, &#8220;whatever you find is mine,
for it was once my room. It is only on
account of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s fine nature and
his constant devotion to the Ideal that he did
not give it to me direct. He knew it would
pain me if he did so. You will remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will remember. You need not fear to
trust me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us shake hands upon our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
compact.&#8221; For a moment, Elaine&#8217;s warm,
rosy hand rested in the clammy, nerveless palm
of Harold Vernon Perkins. &#8220;Last night,&#8221; he
sighed, &#8220;I could not sleep. I was distressed
by noises which appeared to emanate from
the apartment of Mr. Skiles. Did you hear
nothing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; returned Elaine; &#8220;I sleep very
soundly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The privilege of unpoetic souls,&#8221; commented
Mr. Perkins. &#8220;But, as usual, my
restlessness was not without definite and
beautiful result. In the still watches of the
night, I achieved a&mdash;poem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it,&#8221; cried Elaine, rapturously. &#8220;Oh,
if I might hear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Mr. Perkins drew a roll
from his breast pocket. A fresh blue ribbon
held it in cylindrical form, and the drooping
ends waved in careless, artistic fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you might expect, if you knew about
such things,&#8221; he began, clearing his throat,
and all unconscious of the rapid approach of
Mr. Chester, &#8220;it is upon sleep. It is done
in the sonnet form, a very beautiful measure
which I have made my own. I will read it
now.

<p>His voice broke at the end, not so much
from the intrinsic beauty of the lines as from
perceiving Mr. Chester close at hand, grinning
like the fabled pussy-cat of Cheshire, except
that he did not fade away, leaving only the grin.</p>
<p>Elaine felt the alien presence and looked
around. Woman-like, she quickly grasped
the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been having a rare treat, Mr. Chester,&#8221;
she said, in her smoothest tones. &#8220;Mr.
Perkins has very kindly been reading to me his
beautiful <i>Sonnet on Sleep</i>, composed during a
period of wakefulness last night. Did you
hear it? Is it not a most unusual sonnet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed,&#8221; answered Dick, dryly. &#8220;I
never before had the privilege of hearing one
that contained only twelve lines. Dante and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Petrarch and Shakespeare and all those other
ducks put fourteen lines in every blamed sonnet,
for good measure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hurt to the quick, the sensitive poet walked
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can you speak so!&#8221; cried Elaine,
angrily. &#8220;Is not Mr. Perkins privileged to
create a form?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To create a form, yes,&#8221; returned Dick,
easily, &#8220;but not to monkey with an old one.
There&#8217;s a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaine would have followed the injured one
had not Dick interfered. He caught her hand
quickly, a new and unaccountable lump in his
throat suddenly choking his utterance. &#8220;I
say, Elaine,&#8221; he said, huskily, &#8220;you&#8217;re not
thinking of hooking up with that red-furred
lobster, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; responded Elaine, with
icy dignity, &#8220;what your uncouth language
may mean, but I tolerate no interference whatever
with my personal affairs.&#8221; In a moment
she was gone, and Dick watched the slender,
pink-clad figure returning to the house with
ill-concealed emotion.</p>
<p>All Summer, so far, he and Elaine had been
good friends. They had laughed and joked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
and worked together in a care-free, happy-go-lucky
fashion. The arrival of Mr. Perkins
and his sudden admiration of Elaine had crystallised
the situation. Dick knew now what
caused the violent antics of his heart&mdash;a peaceful
and well-behaved organ which had never
before been so disturbed by a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got it,&#8221; said Dick, to himself, deeply
shamed. &#8220;Moonlight, poetry, mit-holding,
and all the rest of it. Never having had it before,
it&#8217;s going hard with me. Why in the
devil wasn&#8217;t I taught to write doggerel when
I was in college? A fellow don&#8217;t stand any
show nowadays unless he&#8217;s a pocket edition
of Byron.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on through the orchard at a
run, instinctively healing a troubled mind by
wearying the body. At the outer edge of it,
he paused.</p>
<p>Suspended by a singularly strong bit of
twine, a small, grinning skull hung from the
lower branch of an apple tree, far out on the
limb. &#8220;Cat&#8217;s skull,&#8221; thought Dick. &#8220;Wonder
who hung it up there?&#8221;</p>
<p>He lingered, idly, for a moment or two,
then observed that a small patch of grass
directly underneath it was of that season&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
growth. His curiosity fully awake, he determined
to dig a bit, though he had dug fruitlessly
in many places since he came to the
Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle couldn&#8217;t do anything conventional,&#8221;
he said to himself, &#8220;and I&#8217;m pretty
sure he wouldn&#8217;t want any of his relations to
have his money. Here goes, just for luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back to the barn for the spade,
which already had fresh earth on it&mdash;the
evidence of an early morning excavation privately
made by Mrs. Smithers in a spot where
she had dreamed gold was hidden. He went
off to the orchard with it, whistling, his progress
being furtively watched with great interest
by the sour-faced handmaiden in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>Back in the orchard again, he worked
feverishly, possessed by a pleasant thrill of
excitement, somewhat similar to that conceivably
enlivening the humdrum existence
of Captain Kidd. Dick was far from surprised
when his spade struck something hard,
and, his hands trembling with eagerness, he
lifted out a tin box of the kind commonly
used for private papers.</p>
<p>It was locked, but a twist of his muscular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
hands sufficed to break it open. Then he
saw that it was a spring lock, and that, with
grim, characteristic humour, Uncle Ebeneezer
had placed the key inside the box. There
were papers there&mdash;and money, the coins
and bills being loosely scattered about, and
the papers firmly sealed in an envelope addressed
&#8220;To Whom it May Concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick counted the coins and smoothed out
the bills, more puzzled than he had ever been
in his life. He was tempted to open the envelope,
but refrained, not at all sure that he
was among those whom it concerned. For
the space of half an hour he stood there,
frowning, then he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just put it back,&#8221; he said to himself.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not for me to monkey with Uncle
Ebeneezer&#8217;s purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He buried the box in its old place, and
even cut a bit of sod from a distant part of
the orchard to hide the traces of his work.
When all was smooth again, he went back
to the barn, swinging the spade carelessly
but no longer whistling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old devil,&#8221; he muttered, with keen
appreciation. &#8220;The wise old devil!&#8221;</p>

<h3>Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s Fifth Fate</h3>
</div>

<p><i>Morning lay fair upon the land, and yet
the Lady Elaine was weary. Like a drooping
lily she swayed in her saddle, sick at heart
and cast down. Earnestly her company of
gallant knights strove to cheer her, but in
vain. Even the merry quips of the fool in
motley, who still rode at her side, brought no
smile to her beautiful face.</i></p>
<p><i>Presently, he became silent, his heart deeply
troubled because of her. An hour passed so,
and no word was spoken, then, timidly enough,
he ventured another jest.</i></p>
<p><i>The Lady Elaine turned. &#8220;Say no more,
fool,&#8221; she commanded, &#8220;but get out thy
writing tablet and compose me a poem. I
would fain hear something sad and tender in
place of this endless folly.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Le Jongleur bowed. &#8220;And the subject,
Princess?&#8221;</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p><i>Elaine laughed bitterly. &#8220;Myself,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Why not? Myself, Elaine, and this
foolish quest of mine!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Then, for a space, there was silence upon
the road, since the fool, with his writing tablet,
had dropped back to the rear of the
company, and the gallant knights, perceiving
the mood of their mistress, spoke not.</i></p>
<p><i>At noon, when the white sun trembled at
the zenith, Le Jongleur urged his donkey forward,
and presented to Elaine a glorious rose
which he had found blooming at the wayside.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;The poem is finished, your highness,&#8221; he
breathed, doffing his cap, &#8220;but &#8217;tis all unworthy,
so I bring thee this rose also, that
something in my offering may of a certainty
be sweet.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>He would have put the scroll into her hand,
but she swerved her palfrey aside. &#8220;Read
it,&#8221; she said, impatiently; &#8220;I have no mind
to try my wits with thy poor scrawls.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>So, with his voice trembling, and overwhelmed
with self-consciousness, the fool read

<p>Harlan had never written any poetry before,
but it had always seemed easy. Now,
as he read the verses over again, he was
tremendously satisfied with his achievement.
Unconsciously, he had modelled it upon an
exquisite little bit by some one else, which
had once been reprinted beneath a &#8220;story&#8221;
of his own when he was on the paper. He
read it aloud, to see how it sounded, and was
more pleased than ever with the swing of the
verse and the music of the words. &#8220;It&#8217;s
pretty close to art,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;if it
isn&#8217;t the real thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the luncheon bell rang, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
went out to the midday &#8220;gab-fest,&#8221; as
he inwardly characterised it. The meal proceeded
to dessert without any unusual disturbance,
then the diminutive Ebeneezer
threw the remnants of his cup of milk into
his mother&#8217;s face, and was carried off,
howling, to be spanked. Like many other
mothers, Mrs. Holmes resented her children&#8217;s
conduct when it incommoded her, but not
otherwise, and though milk baths are said
to be fine for the complexion, she was not
altogether pleased with the manner of application.</p>
<p>Amid the vocal pyrotechnics from the
Holmes apartments, Harlan escaped into the
library, but his poem was gone. He searched
for it vainly, then sat down to write it over
before he should forget it. This done, he
went on with Elaine and her adventures, and
presently forgot all about the lost page.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that do your heart good?&#8221; inquired
Mrs. Dodd, of Dorothy, inclining her
head toward Mrs. Holmes&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be it ever so humble,&#8221; sang Dick, strolling
out of the room, &#8220;there&#8217;s no place like
Holmes&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr admitted that her ears were not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
yet so calloused but that the sound gave her
distinct pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that there little limb of Satan had have
throwed his milk in anybody else&#8217;s face,&#8221;
went on Mrs. Dodd, &#8220;all she&#8217;d have said
would have been: &#8216;Ebbie, don&#8217;t spill your
nice milk. That&#8217;s naughty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her imitation of the fond mother&#8217;s tone and
manner was so wickedly exact that Dorothy
laughed heartily. The others had fled to a
more quiet spot, except Willie and Rebecca,
who were fighting for a place at the keyhole
of their mother&#8217;s door. Finally, Willie gained
possession of the keyhole, and the ingenious
Rebecca, lying flat on her small stomach,
peered under the door, and obtained a pleasing
view of what was going on inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen at that!&#8221; cried Mrs. Dodd, her
countenance fairly beaming with innocent
pleasure. &#8220;I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; most as much good
out of it as I would from goin&#8217; to the circus.
Reckon it&#8217;s a slipper, for it sounds just like
little Jimmie Young&#8217;s weepin&#8217; did the night I
come home from my fifth honeymoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only time,&#8221; she went on,
reminiscently, &#8220;as I was ever a step-ma to
children what wasn&#8217;t growed up. You&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
think a woman as had been married four
times afore would have knowed better &#8217;n to
get her fool head into a noose like that, but
there seems to be only one way for folks to
learn things, an&#8217; that&#8217;s by their own experience.
If we could only use other folks&#8217; experience,
this here world would be heaven
in about three generations, but we&#8217;re so constituted
that we never believe fire &#8217;ll burn till
we poke our own fingers into it to see. Other
folks&#8217; scars don&#8217;t go no ways at all toward
convincin&#8217; us.</p>
<p>&#8220;You read lots of novels about the sorrers
of step-children, but I ain&#8217;t never come up
with no epic as yet portrayin&#8217; the sufferin&#8217;s of
a step-ma. If I had a talent like your husband&#8217;s
got, I&#8217;ll be blest if I wouldn&#8217;t do it.
What I went through with them children
aged me ten years in less &#8217;n three.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like this,&#8221; she prattled on. &#8220;I&#8217;d
never seen a one of &#8217;em, they livin&#8217; far away
from their pa, as was necessary if their pa was
to get any peace an&#8217; happiness out &#8217;n life, an&#8217;
that lyin&#8217; creeter I married told me there was
only three. My dear, there was eight, an&#8217;
sixteen ordinary young ones couldn&#8217;t have
been no worse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our courtin&#8217; was done mainly in the cemetery.
I&#8217;d just laid my fourth away in his
proper place an&#8217; had the letterin&#8217; all cut nice
on his side of the monumint, an&#8217; I was doin&#8217;
the plantin&#8217; on the grave when I met my
fate&mdash;my fifth fate, I&#8217;m speakin&#8217; of now. I
allers aimed to do right by my husbands when
they was dead no less &#8217;n when they was livin&#8217;,
an&#8217; I allers planted each one&#8217;s favourite
flower on his last restin&#8217;-place, an&#8217; planted it
thick, so &#8217;s when the last trump sounded an&#8217;
they all riz up, there wouldn&#8217;t be no one of
&#8217;em that could accuse me of bein&#8217; partial.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the flowers was funny for a
graveyard. One of &#8217;em loved sunflowers, an&#8217;
when blossomin&#8217;-time come, you could see a
spot of light in my lot clear from the gate
when you went in, an&#8217; on sunny days even
from quite a piece outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geraniums was on the next grave, red
an&#8217; pink together, as William loved to see &#8217;em,
an&#8217; most fittin&#8217; an&#8217; appropriate. He was a
queer-lookin&#8217; man, William was, all bald except
for a little fringe of red hair around his
head, an&#8217; his bald spot gettin&#8217; as pink as anythin&#8217;
when he got mad. I never could abide
red an&#8217; pink together, so I did my best not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
rile him; but la sakes, my dear, red-haired
folks is that touchy that you never can tell
what&#8217;s goin&#8217; to rile &#8217;em an&#8217; what ain&#8217;t.
Some innercent little remark is as likely to set
&#8217;em off as anythin&#8217; else. All the time it&#8217;s like
carryin&#8217; a light into a fireworks place. Drop
it once an&#8217; the air &#8217;ll be full of sky-rockets,
roman candles, pinwheels, an&#8217; set pieces till
you&#8217;re that dazed you don&#8217;t know where
you&#8217;re livin&#8217;. Don&#8217;t never take no red-haired
one, my dear, if you&#8217;re anyways set on
peace. I never took but one, but that was
enough to set me dead against the breed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I was a-sayin&#8217;, James begun to
woo me in the cemetery. Whenever you see
a man in a cemetery, my dear, you can take
it for granted that he&#8217;s a new-made widower.
After the first week or two, he ain&#8217;t got no
time to go to no grave, he&#8217;s so busy lookin&#8217;
out for the next one. When I see James a-waterin&#8217;
an&#8217; a-weedin&#8217; on the next lot to
mine, therefore, I knowed his sorrer was
new, even though the band of crape on his
hat was rusty an&#8217; old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bein&#8217; fellow-mourners, in a way, we
struck up kind of a melancholy friendship, an&#8217;
finally got to borrerin&#8217; water from each other&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
sprinklin&#8217; cans an&#8217; exchangin&#8217; flower seeds an&#8217;
slips, an&#8217; even hull plants. That old deceiver
told me it was his first wife that was a-lyin&#8217;
there, an&#8217; showed me her name on the monumint.
She was buried in her own folks&#8217; lot,
an&#8217; I never knowed till it was too late that his
own lot was plum full of wives, an&#8217; this here
was a annex, so to speak. I dunno how I
come to be so took in, but anyways, when
James&#8217;s grief had subsided somewhat, we
decided to travel on the remainin&#8217; stretch
through this vale of tears together.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me he had a beautiful home in
Taylorville, but was a-livin&#8217; where he was
so &#8217;s to be near the cemetery an&#8217; where he
could look after dear Annie&#8217;s grave. The
sentiment made me think all the more of him,
so &#8217;s I didn&#8217;t hesitate, an&#8217; was even willin&#8217; to
be married with one of my old rings, to save
the expense of a new one. James allers was
thrifty, an&#8217; the way he put it, it sounded quite
reasonable, so &#8217;s that&#8217;s how it comes, my
dear, that in spite of havin&#8217; had seven husbands,
I&#8217;ve only got six weddin&#8217;-rings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I put each one on when its own proper
anniversary comes around an&#8217; wear it till the
next one, when I change again, though for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
one of the rings it makes only one day, because
the fourth and seventh times I was
married so near together. That sounds queer,
my dear, but if you think it over, you&#8217;ll see
what I mean. It&#8217;s fortunate, too, in a way,
&#8217;cause I found out by accident years afterward
that my fourth weddin&#8217;-ring come out
of a pawn-shop, an&#8217; I never took much joy
out of wearin&#8217; it. Bein&#8217; just alike, I wore
another one mostly, even when Samuel was
alive, but he never noticed. Besides, I reckon
&#8217;t wouldn&#8217;t make no difference, for a man
that&#8217;ll go to a pawn-shop for a weddin&#8217;-ring
ain&#8217;t one to make a row about his wife&#8217;s
changin&#8217; it. When I spoke sharp to him
about it, he snickered, an&#8217; said it was appropriate
enough, though to this day I&#8217;ve never
figured out precisely just what the old serpent
meant by it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I was sayin&#8217;, my dear, the minister
married us in good an&#8217; proper form, an&#8217;
I must say that, though I&#8217;ve had all kinds of
ceremonies, I take to the &#8217;Piscopal one the
most, in spite of havin&#8217; been brought up
Methodis&#8217;, an&#8217; hereafter I&#8217;ll be married by it
if the occasion should arise&mdash;an&#8217; we drove
over to Taylorville.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The roads was dretful, but bein&#8217; experienced
in marriage, I could see that it wasn&#8217;t
that that was makin&#8217; James drop the whip,
an&#8217; pull back on the lines when he wanted the
horses to go faster, an&#8217; not hear things I was
a-sayin&#8217; to him. Finally, I says, very distinct:
&#8216;James, dear, how many children did you say
you had?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Eight,&#8217; says he, clearin&#8217; his throat proud
and haughty like.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re lyin&#8217;,&#8217; says I, &#8216;an&#8217; you know
you&#8217;re lyin&#8217;. You allers told me you had
three.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was speakin&#8217; of those by my first
wife,&#8217; says he. &#8216;My other wives all left one
apiece. Ain&#8217;t I never told you about &#8217;em? I
thought I had,&#8217; he went on, speakin&#8217; quick,
&#8216;but if I haven&#8217;t, it &#8217;s because your beauty
has made me forget all the pain an&#8217; sorrer of
the past.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that he clicked to the horses so
sudden that I was near threw out of the rig,
but it wasn&#8217;t half so bad as the other jolt
he&#8217;d just give me. For a long time I didn&#8217;t
say nothin&#8217;, an&#8217; there&#8217;s nothin&#8217; that makes a
man so uneasy as a woman that don&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217;, my dear, so you just write that down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
in your little book, an&#8217; remember it. It&#8217;ll
come in handy long before you&#8217;re through
with your first marriage an&#8217; have begun on
your second. Havin&#8217; been through four, I
was well skilled in keepin&#8217; my mouth shut,
an&#8217; I never said a word till we drove into the
yard of the most disconsolate-lookin&#8217; premises
I ever seen since I was took to the poorhouse
on a visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;James,&#8217; says I, cool but firm, &#8216;is this
your magnificent residence?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is,&#8217; says he, very soft, &#8216;an&#8217; it is here
that I welcome my bride. Have you ever
seen anythin&#8217; like this view?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; says I, &#8216;I never have&#8217;; an&#8217; it was
gospel truth I was speakin&#8217;, too, for never before
had I been to a place where the pigsty
was in front.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is a wonderful view,&#8217; says I, sarcastic
like, &#8216;but before I linger to admire it more, I
would love to look upon the scenery inside
the house.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we went in, I thought I was either
dreamin&#8217; or had got to Bedlam. The seven
youngest children was raisin&#8217; particular Cain,
an&#8217; the oldest, a pretty little girl of thirteen,
was doin&#8217; her best to quiet &#8217;em. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
six others besides what had been accounted
for, but I soon found that they belonged to a
neighbour, an&#8217; was just visitin&#8217; to relieve the
monotony.</p>
<p>&#8220;The woman James had left takin&#8217; care of
&#8217;em had been gone two weeks an&#8217; more, with
a month&#8217;s wages still comin&#8217; to her, which
James never felt called on to pay, on account
of her havin&#8217; left without notice. James was
dretful thrifty. The youngest one was puttin&#8217;
the cat into the water-pitcher, an&#8217; as soon as
I found out what his name was, I called him
sharp by it an&#8217; told him to quit. He put his
tongue out at me as sassy as you please, an&#8217;
says: &#8216;I won&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my dear, I didn&#8217;t wait to hear no
more, but I opened my satchel an&#8217; took out
one of my slippers an&#8217; give that child a lickin&#8217;
that he&#8217;ll remember when he&#8217;s a grandparent.
&#8216;Hereafter,&#8217; says I, &#8216;when I tell you
to do anythin&#8217;, you&#8217;ll do it. I&#8217;ll speak kind
the first time an&#8217; firm the second, and the
third time the whole thing will be illustrated
so plain that nobody can&#8217;t misunderstand it.
Your pa has took me into a confidence game,&#8217;
says I, speakin&#8217; to all the children, &#8216;but I was
never one to draw back from what I&#8217;d put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
my hand to, an&#8217; I aim to do right by you if
you do right by me. You mind,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;an&#8217; you won&#8217;t have no trouble; an&#8217; the same
thing,&#8217; says I to James, &#8216;applies to you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt sorry for all those poor little motherless
things, with a liar for a pa, an&#8217; all the
time I lived there, I tried to make up to &#8217;em
what I could, but step-mas have their sorrers,
my dear, that&#8217;s what they do, an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t
never seen no piece about it in the paper yet,
either.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll excuse me now, my dear, I&#8217;ll
go to my room. It&#8217;s just come to my mind
now that this here is one of my anniversaries,
an&#8217; I&#8217;ll have to look up the facts in my family
Bible, an&#8217; change my ring.&#8221;</p>
<p>At dinner-time the chastised and chastened
twin appeared in freshly starched raiment.
His eyes were swollen and his face flushed, but
otherwise his recent painful experience had remarkably
improved him. He said &#8220;please&#8221;
and &#8220;thank you,&#8221; and did not even resent it
when Willie slyly dropped a small piece of
watermelon down his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;This afternoon,&#8221; said Elaine, &#8220;Mr. Perkins
composed a beautiful poem. I know it
is beautiful, though I have not yet heard it. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
do not wish to be selfish in my pleasure, so I
will ask him to read it to us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The poet&#8217;s face suddenly became the colour
of his hair. He dropped his napkin, and
swiftly whispered to Elaine, while he was
picking it up, that she herself was the subject
of the poem.</p>
<p>&#8220;How perfectly charming,&#8221; said Elaine,
clearly. &#8220;Did you hear, Mrs. Carr? Poor
little, insignificant me has actually inspired a
great poem. Oh, do read it, Mr. Perkins?
We are all dying to hear it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fairly cornered, the poet muttered that he
had lost it&mdash;some other time&mdash;wait until to-morrow&mdash;and
so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to wait,&#8221; said Dick, with an ironical
smile. &#8220;It was lost, but now is found.
I came upon it myself, blowing around unheeded
under the library window, quite like a
common bit of paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins was transfixed with amazement,
for his cherished poem was at that
minute in his breast pocket. He clutched at
it spasmodically, to be sure it was still safe.</p>
<p>Very different emotions possessed Harlan,
who choked on his food. He instinctively
guessed the worst, and saw his home in lurid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
ruin about him, but was powerless to avert
the catastrophe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it, Dick,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, kindly.
&#8220;We are all a-perishin&#8217; to hear it. I can&#8217;t
eat another bite until I do. I reckon it&#8217;ll
sound like a valentine,&#8221; she concluded, with a
malicious glance at Mr. Perkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have taken the liberty,&#8221; chuckled Dick,
&#8220;of changing a word or two occasionally, to
make better sense of it, and of leaving out
some lines altogether. Every one is privileged
to vary an established form.&#8221; Without
further preliminary, he read the improved
version.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; said Miss St. Clair, crisply.
&#8220;Mr. Perkins, may I ask as a favour that you
will not speak to me again?&#8221; She marched
out with her head high, and Mr. Perkins,
wholly unstrung, buried his face in his napkin.</p>
<p>Harlan laughed&mdash;a loud, ringing laugh, such
as Dorothy had not heard from him for
months, and striding around the table, he
grasped Dick&#8217;s hand in tremendous relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me have it,&#8221; he cried, eagerly. &#8220;Give
me all of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Dick, readily, passing over
both sheets of paper.</p>
<p>Harlan went into the library with the composition,
and presently, when Dick was walking
around the house and saw bits of torn
paper fluttering out of the open window, a
light broke through his usual density.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
darned! I&#8217;ll be everlastingly darned! Idiot!&#8221;
he continued, savagely. &#8220;Oh, if I could only
kick myself! Poor Dorothy! I wonder if
she knows!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>Treasure-Trove</h3>
</div>

<p>The August moon swung high in the
heavens, and the crickets chirped unbearably.
The luminous dew lay heavily
upon the surrounding fields, and now and
then a stray breeze, amid the overhanging
branches of the trees that lined the roadway,
aroused in the consciousness of the single
wayfarer a feeling closely akin to panic. When
he reached the summit of the hill, he was
trembling violently.</p>
<p>In the dooryard of the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern, he
paused. It was dark, save for a single round
window. In an upper front room a night-lamp,
turned low, gave one leering eye to the
grotesque exterior of the house.</p>
<p>With his heart thumping loudly, Mr. Bradford
leaned against a tree and divested himself
of his shoes. From a package under his arm,
he took out a pair of soft felt slippers, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
paper rattling loudly as he did so. He put
them on, hesitated, then went cautiously up
the walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all my seventy-eight years,&#8221; he thought,
&#8220;I have never done anything like this. If I
had not promised the Colonel&mdash;but a promise
to a dying man is sacred, especially when he
is one&#8217;s best friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of the key in the lock seemed
almost like an explosion of dynamite. Mr.
Bradford wiped the cold perspiration from his
forehead, turned the door slowly upon its
squeaky hinges, and went in, feeling like a
burglar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not a burglar,&#8221; he thought, his hands
shaking. &#8220;I have come to give, not to take
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fearfully, he tiptoed into the parlour, expecting
at any moment to arouse the house.
Feeling his way carefully along the wall, and
guided by the moonlight which streamed in
at the side windows, he came to the wing
occupied by Mrs. Holmes and her exuberant
offspring. Here he stooped, awkwardly, and
slipped a sealed and addressed letter under
the door, heaving a sigh of relief as he got
away without having wakened any one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>The sounds which came from Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s
room were reassuringly suggestive of sleep.
Hastily, he slipped another letter under her
door, then made his way cautiously to the
kitchen. The missive intended for Mrs.
Smithers was left on the door-mat outside,
for, as Mr. Bradford well knew, the
ears of the handmaiden were uncomfortably
keen.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs he hesitated again,
but by the time he reached the top, his heart
had ceased to beat audibly. He tiptoed down
the corridor to Uncle Israel&#8217;s room, then, further
on, to Dick&#8217;s. The letter intended for
Mr. Perkins was slipped under Elaine&#8217;s door,
Mr. Bradford not being aware that the poet
had changed his room. Having safely accomplished
his last errand, the tension relaxed,
and he went downstairs with more assurance,
his pace being unduly hastened by a subdued
howl from one of the twins.</p>
<p>Bidding himself be calm, he got to the front
door, and drew a long breath of relief as he
closed it noiselessly. There was a light in
Mrs. Holmes&#8217;s room now, and Mr. Bradford
did not wish to linger. He gathered up his
shoes and fairly ran downhill, arriving at his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
office much shaken in mind and body, nearly
two hours after he had started.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;why
the Colonel should have been so particular as
to dates and hours, but he knew his own business
best.&#8221; Then, further in accordance with
his instructions, he burned a number of letters
which could not be delivered personally.</p>
<p>If Mr. Bradford could have seen the company
which met at the breakfast table the following
morning, he would have been amply
repaid for his supreme effort of the night before,
had he been blessed with any sense of humour
at all. The Carrs were untroubled, and Elaine
appeared as usual, except for her haughty indifference
to Mr. Perkins. She thought he
had written a letter to himself and slipped it
under her door, in order to compel her to
speak to him, but she had tactfully avoided
that difficulty by leaving it on his own threshold.
Dick&#8217;s eyes were dancing and at intervals
his mirth bubbled over, needlessly, as
every one else appeared to think.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doesn&#8217;t know wot folks finds to laugh
at,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Smithers, as she brought
in the coffee; &#8220;that&#8217;s wot I doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a
solemn time, I take it, when the sheeted spectres
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
of the dead walks abroad by night, that&#8217;s
wot it is. It&#8217;s time for folks to be thinkin&#8217;
about their immortal souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>This enigmatical utterance produced a startling
effect. Mr. Perkins turned a pale green
and hastily excused himself, his breakfast
wholly untouched. Mrs. Holmes dropped
her fork and recovered it in evident confusion.
Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s face was a bright scarlet and appeared
about to burst, but she kept her lips
compressed into a thin, tight line. Uncle Israel
nodded over his predigested food. &#8220;Just
so,&#8221; he mumbled; &#8220;a solemn time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eagerly watching for an opportunity, Mrs.
Holmes dived into the barn, and emerged,
cautiously, with the spade concealed under
her skirts. She carried it into her own apartment
and hid it under Willie&#8217;s bed. Mrs.
Smithers went to look for it a little later, and,
discovering that it was unaccountably missing,
excavated her own private spade from beneath
the hay. During the afternoon, the poet was
observed lashing the fire-shovel to the other
end of a decrepit rake. Uncle Israel, after a
fruitless search of the premises, actually went
to town and came back with a bulky and awkward
parcel, which he hid in the shrubbery.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Willie had gone whimpering
to Mrs. Dodd, who was in serious trouble of
her own. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he admitted, when
closely questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221; demanded his counsellor,
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of ma,&#8221; sobbed Willie. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a-goin&#8217; to bury me. She&#8217;s got the spade hid
under my bed now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sudden emotion completely changed Mrs.
Dodd&#8217;s countenance. &#8220;There, there, Willie,&#8221;
she said, stroking him kindly. &#8220;Where is
your ma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s out in the orchard with Ebbie and
Rebbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well now, deary, don&#8217;t you say nothin&#8217;
at all to your ma, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll fool her. The
idea of buryin&#8217; a nice little boy like you! You
just go an&#8217; get me that spade an&#8217; I&#8217;ll hide it
in my room. Then, when your ma asks for
it, you don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Willie&#8217;s troubled face brightened, and presently
the implement was under Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s
own bed, and her door locked. Much relieved
in his mind and cherishing kindly sentiments
toward his benefactor, Willie slid down the
banisters, unrebuked, the rest of the afternoon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Dodd sat on the porch and
meditated. &#8220;I&#8217;d never have thought,&#8221; she
said to herself, &#8220;that Ebeneezer would intend
that Holmes woman to have any of it, but
you never can tell what folks&#8217;ll do when their
minds gets to failin&#8217; at the end. Ebeneezer&#8217;s
mind must have failed dretful, for I know he
didn&#8217;t make no promise to her, same as he
did to me, an&#8217; if she don&#8217;t suspect nothin&#8217;,
what did she go an&#8217; get the spade for? Dretful
likely hand it is, for spirit writin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking about furtively to make sure that
she was not observed, Mrs. Dodd drew out
of the mysterious recesses of her garments,
the crumpled communication of the night before.
It was dated, &#8220;Heaven, August 12th,&#8221;
and the penmanship was Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
to the life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Belinda,&#8221; it read. &#8220;I find myself
at the last moment obliged to change my
plans. If you will go to the orchard at exactly
twelve o&#8217;clock on the night of August
13th, you will find there what you seek. Go
straight ahead to the ninth row of apple trees,
then seven trees to the left. A cat&#8217;s skull
hangs from the lower branch, if it hasn&#8217;t
blown down or been taken away. Dig here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
and you will find a tin box containing what I
have always meant you to have.</p>
<p>&#8220;I charge you by all you hold sacred to
obey these directions in every particular, and
unless you want to lose it all, to say nothing
about it to any one who may be in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to put you to this inconvenience,
but the limitations of the spirit
world cannot well be explained to mortals. I
hope you will make a wise use of the money
and not spend it all on clothes, as women are
apt to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;In conclusion, let me say that I am very
happy in heaven, though it is considerably
more quiet than any place I ever lived in before.
I have met a great many friends here,
but no relatives except my wife. Farewell,
as I shall probably never see you again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours,</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>&#8220;Ebeneezer Judson.</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;P.S. All of your previous husbands are
here, in the sunny section set aside for martyrs.
None of them give you a good reputation.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;E. J.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t it beat all,&#8221; muttered Mrs. Dodd to
herself, excitedly. &#8220;Here was Ebeneezer at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
my door last night, an&#8217; I never knowed it.
Sakes alive, if I had knowed it, I wouldn&#8217;t
have slep&#8217; like I did. Here comes that Holmes
hussy. Wonder what she knows!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe in spirits, Mrs. Dodd?&#8221;
inquired Mrs. Holmes, in a careless tone that
did not deceive her listener.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depends,&#8221; returned the other, with an
evident distaste for the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you believe spirits can walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t never seen no spirits walk, but I&#8217;ve
seen folks try to walk that was full of spirits,
and there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no visible improvement in
their steppin&#8217;.&#8221; This was a pleasant allusion
to the departed Mr. Holmes, who was currently
said to have &#8220;drunk hisself to death.&#8221;</p>
<p>A scarlet flush, which mounted to the roots
of Mrs. Holmes&#8217;s hair, indicated that the shot
had told, and Mrs. Dodd went to her own
room, where she carefully locked herself in.
She was determined to sit upon her precious
spade until midnight, if it were necessary, to
keep it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers was sitting up in bed with
the cold perspiration oozing from every pore,
when the kitchen clock struck twelve sharp,
quick strokes. The other clocks in the house
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
took up the echo and made merry with it.
The grandfather&#8217;s clock in the hall was the
last to strike, and the twelve deep-toned notes
boomed a solemn warning which, to more
than one quaking listener, bore a strong suggestion
of another world&mdash;an uncanny world
at that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll go along,&#8221; said Dick to himself,
yawning and stretching. &#8220;I might just
as well see the fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers, with her private spade and
her odorous lantern, was at the spot first,
closely seconded by Mrs. Dodd, in a voluminous
garment of red flannel which had
seen all of its best days and not a few of its
worst. Trembling from head to foot, came
Mrs. Holmes, carrying a pair of shears, which
she had snatched up at the last moment when
she discovered the spade was missing. Mr.
Perkins, fully garbed, appeared with his improvised
shovel. Uncle Israel, in his piebald
dressing-gown, tottered along in the rear,
bearing his spade, still unwrapped, his bedroom
candle, and a box of matches. Dick
surveyed the scene from a safe, shadowy
distance, and on a branch near the skull,
Claudius Tiberius was stretched at full length,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
purring with a loud, resonant purr which
could be heard from afar.</p>
<p>After the first shock of surprise, which was
especially keen on the part of Mrs. Dodd,
when she saw Uncle Israel in the company,
Mrs. Smithers broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothink more nor a wild-goose
chase,&#8221; she said, resentfully. &#8220;A-gettin&#8217; us
all out&#8217;n our beds at this time o&#8217; night! It&#8217;s
a sufferin&#8217; and dyin&#8217; shame, that&#8217;s wot it is,
and if sperrits was like other folks, &#8217;t wouldn&#8217;t
&#8217;ave happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarah,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, firmly, &#8220;keep
your mouth shut. Israel, will you dig?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all dig,&#8221; said Mrs. Holmes, in the
voice of authority, and thereafter the dirt flew
briskly enough, accompanied by the laboured
breathing of perspiring humanity.</p>
<p>It was Uncle Israel&#8217;s spade that first touched
the box, and, with a cry of delight, he stooped
for it, as did everybody else. By sheer force
of muscle, Mrs. Dodd got it away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This wrangle,&#8221; sighed Mr. Perkins, &#8220;is
both unseemly and sordid. Let us all agree
to abide by dear Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s last bequests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be no desire not to abide by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
&#8217;em,&#8221; snorted Mrs. Smithers, &#8220;wot with cats
as can&#8217;t stay buried and sheeted spectres of
the dead a-walkin&#8217; through the house by
night!&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time, Mrs. Dodd had the box open,
and a cry of astonishment broke from her
lips. Several heads were badly bumped in
the effort to peep into the box, and an unprotected
sneeze from Uncle Israel added to the
general unpleasantness.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can all go away,&#8221; cried Mrs. Dodd,
shrilly. &#8220;There&#8217;s two one-dollar bills here,
two quarters, an&#8217; two nickels an&#8217; eight pennies.
&#8217;T aint nothin&#8217; to be fit over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the letter,&#8221; suggested Mr. Perkins,
hopefully. &#8220;Is there not a letter from dear
Uncle Ebeneezer? Let us gather around the
box in a reverent spirit and listen to dear
Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s last words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can read &#8217;em,&#8221; snapped Mrs. Holmes,
&#8220;if you&#8217;re set on hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel wheezed so loudly that for the
moment he drowned the deep purr of Claudius
Tiberius. When quiet was restored, Mr.
Perkins broke the seal of the envelope and
unfolded the communication within. Uncle
Israel held the dripping candle on one side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
and Mrs. Smithers the smoking lantern on the
other, while near by, Dick watched the midnight
assembly with an unholy glee which,
in spite of his efforts, nearly became audible.</p>
<p>&#8220;How beautiful,&#8221; said Mr. Perkins, &#8220;to
think that dear Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s last words
should be given to us in this unexpected but
original way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; said Mrs. Smithers, emphatically,
&#8220;and read them last words. I&#8217;m
gettin&#8217; the pneumony now, that&#8217;s wot I
am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the only one,&#8221; chirped Mrs. Dodd,
hysterically. &#8220;The money in this here box
is all old.&#8221; It was, indeed. Mr. Judson
seemed to have purposely chosen ragged bills
and coins worn smooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Dear Relations,&#8217;&#8221; began Mr. Perkins.
&#8220;&#8216;As every one of you have at one time or
another routed me out of bed to let you in
when you have come to my house on the
night train, and always uninvited&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did,&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Holmes.
&#8220;I always came in the daytime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody ain&#8217;t come at night,&#8221; explained
Mrs. Smithers, &#8220;since &#8217;e fixed the &#8217;ouse over
into a face. One female fainted dead away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
when &#8217;er started up the hill and see it a-winkin&#8217;
at &#8217;er, yes sir, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;er did!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It seems only fitting and appropriate,&#8217;&#8221;
continued Mr. Perkins, &#8220;&#8216;that you should all
see how it seems.&#8217;&#8221; The poet wiped his
massive brow with his soiled handkerchief.
&#8220;Dear uncle!&#8221; he commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; wheezed Uncle Israel, &#8220;&#8216;dear uncle!&#8217;
Damn his stingy old soul,&#8221; he added, with
uncalled-for emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It gives me pleasure to explain in this
fashion my disposal of my estate,&#8221; the reader
went on, huskily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the connection on both sides, there
is only one that has never been to see me,
unless I&#8217;ve forgotten some, and that is my
beloved nephew, James Harlan Carr.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him,&#8221; creaked Uncle Israel. &#8220;Him, as
never see Ebeneezer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has never,&#8221; continued the poet, with
difficulty, &#8220;rung my door bell at night, nor
eaten me out of house and home, nor written
begging letters&mdash;&#8221; this phrase was well-nigh
inaudible&mdash;&#8220;nor had fits on me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Here there was a pause and all eyes were
fastened upon Uncle Israel.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;T wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a fit!&#8221; he screamed. &#8220;It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
a involuntary spasm brought on by takin&#8217;
two searchin&#8217; medicines too near together.
&#8217;T wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a fit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor children&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea!&#8221; snapped Mrs. Holmes. &#8220;Poor
little Ebbie and Rebbie had to be born somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor paralysis&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Cousin Si Martin,&#8221; said Mrs.
Dodd, half to herself. &#8220;He was took bad
with it in the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has never come to spend Christmas
with me and remained until the ensuing dog
days, nor sent me a crayon portrait of himself&#8221;&mdash;Mr.
Perkins faltered here, but nobly
went on&mdash;&#8220;nor had typhoid fever, nor finished
up his tuberculosis, nor cut teeth, nor
set the house on fire with a bath cabinet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At this juncture Uncle Israel was so overcome
with violent emotion that it was some
time before the reading could proceed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never having come into any kind of relations
with my dear nephew, James Harlan
Carr,&#8221; continued Mr. Perkins, in troubled
tones, &#8220;I have shown my gratitude in this
humble way. To him I give the house and
all my furniture, my books and personal effects
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
of every kind, my farm in Hill County, two
thousand acres, all improved and clear of incumbrance,
except blooded stock,&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knowed &#8217;e &#8217;ad no farm,&#8221; interrupted
Mrs. Smithers.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the ten thousand and eighty-four
dollars in the City Bank which at this writing
is there to my credit, but will be duly transferred,
and my dear Rebecca&#8217;s diamond pin to
be given to my beloved nephew&#8217;s wife when
he marries. It is all in my will, which my
dear friend Jeremiah Bradford has, and which
he will read at the proper time to those
concerned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old snake!&#8221; shrieked Mrs. Holmes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further,&#8221; went on the poet, almost past
speech by this time, &#8220;I direct that the remainder
of my estate, which is here in this
box, shall be divided as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight cents each to that loafer, Si Martin,
his lazy wife, and their eight badly brought-up
children, with instructions to be generous
to any additions to said children through matrimony
or natural causes; Fanny Wood and
that poor, white-livered creature she married,
thereby proving her own idiocy if it needed
proof; Uncle James&#8217;s cross-eyed third wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
and her two silly daughters; Rebecca&#8217;s sister&#8217;s
scoundrelly second husband, with his
foolish wife and their little boy with a face
like a pug dog; Uncle Jason, who has needed
a bath ever since I knew him&mdash;I want he
should spend his legacy for soap&mdash;and his epileptic
stepson, whose name I forget, though
he lived with me five years hand-running;
lying Sally Simmons and her half-witted
daughter; that old hen, Belinda Dodd; that
skunk, Harold Vernon Perkins, who never
did a stroke of honest work in his life till he
began to dig for this box; monkey-faced Lucretia
and the four thieving little Riley children,
who are likely to get into prison when they
grow up; that human undertaker&#8217;s waggon,
Betsey Skiles, and her two impudent nieces;
that grand old perambulating drug store, Israel
Skiles; that Holmes fool with the three
reprints of her ugliness&mdash;eight cents apiece,
and may you get all possible good out of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick Chester, however, having always
paid his board, and tried to be a help to me in
several small ways, and in spite of having
lived with me eight Summers or more without
having been asked to do so, gets two
thousand two hundred and fifty dollars which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
is deposited for him in the savings department
of the Metropolitan Bank, plus the three hundred
and seventy dollars he paid me for board
without my asking him for it. Sarah Smithers,
being in the main a good woman, though
sharp-tongued at times, and having been faithful
all the time my house has been full of lowdown
cusses too lazy to work for their living,
gets twelve hundred and fifty dollars which is
in the same bank as Dick&#8217;s. The rest of you
take your eight cents apiece and be damned.
You can get the money changed at the store.
If any have been left out, it is my desire that
those remembered should divide with the
unfortunate.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you had not all claimed to be Rebecca&#8217;s
relatives, you would have been kicked out of
my house years ago, but since writing this, I
have seen Rebecca and made it right with
her. It was not her desire that I should be
imposed upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of my house, every one of you,
before noon to-morrow, and the devil has my
sincere sympathy when you go to live with
him and make hell what you have made my
house ever since Rebecca&#8217;s death. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Get out!!!</span></p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>The letter was badly written and incoherent,
yet there could be no doubt of its
meaning, nor of the state of mind in which
it had been penned. For a moment, there
was a tense silence, then Mrs. Dodd tittered
hysterically.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought diamonds was goin&#8217; to be
trumps,&#8221; she observed, &#8220;an&#8217; it turned out to
be spades.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel wheezed again and Mrs. Smithers
smacked her lips with intense satisfaction.
Mrs. Holmes was pale with anger, and, under
cover of the night, Dick sneaked back to his
room, shame-faced, yet happy. Claudius
Tiberius still purred, sticking his claws into
the bark with every evidence of pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; said Mr. Perkins, sadly,
running his fingers through his mane,
&#8220;whether we are obliged to take as final
these vagaries of a dying man. Dear Uncle
Ebeneezer could not have been sane when he
penned this cruel letter. I do not believe it
was his desire to have any of us go away before
the usual time.&#8221; Under cover of these forgiving
sentiments, he pocketed all the money
in the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me neither,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd. &#8220;Anyhow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stay. No sheeted spectre can&#8217;t
scare me away from a place I&#8217;ve always stayed
in Summers, &#8217;specially,&#8221; she added, sarcastically,
&#8220;when I&#8217;m remembered in the will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers clucked disagreeably and went
back to the house. Uncle Israel looked after
her with dismay. &#8220;Do you suppose,&#8221; he
queried, in falsetto, &#8220;that she&#8217;ll tell the
Carrs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, Israel,&#8221; replied Mrs. Dodd. &#8220;She
can&#8217;t tell them Carrs about our diggin&#8217; all night
in the orchard, &#8217;cause she was here herself.
They didn&#8217;t get no spirit communication
an&#8217; they won&#8217;t suspect nothin&#8217;. We&#8217;ll just
stay where we be an&#8217; go on &#8217;s if nothin&#8217; had
happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, this seemed the wisest plan, and,
shivering with the cold, the baffled ones filed
back to the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern. &#8220;How did you
get out, Israel?&#8221; whispered Mrs. Dodd, as
they approached the house.</p>
<p>The old man snickered. It was the only
moment of the evening he had thoroughly enjoyed.
&#8220;The same spirit that give me the
letter, Belinda,&#8221; he returned, pleasantly, &#8220;also
give me a key. You didn&#8217;t think I had no
flyin&#8217; machine, did you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Humph&#8221; grunted Mrs. Dodd. &#8220;Spirits
don&#8217;t carry no keys!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the threshold they paused, the sensitive
poet quite unstrung by the night&#8217;s adventure.
From the depths of the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern came
a shrill, infantile cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that Ebbie,&#8221; asked Mrs. Dodd, &#8220;or
Rebbie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holmes turned upon her with suppressed
fury. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you ever dare to allude
to my children in that manner again,&#8221; she
commanded, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is their names?&#8221; quavered Uncle
Israel, lighting his candle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their names,&#8221; returned Mrs. Holmes, with
a vast accession of dignity, &#8220;are Gladys Gwendolen
and Algernon Paul! Good night!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just before dawn, a sheeted spectre appeared
at the side of Sarah Smither&#8217;s bed, and
swore the trembling woman to secrecy. It
was long past sunrise before the frightened
handmaiden came to her senses enough to recall
that the voice of the apparition had been
strangely like Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>Good Fortune</h3>
</div>

<p>The next morning, Harlan and Dorothy ate
breakfast by themselves. There was
suppressed excitement in the manner of Mrs.
Smithers, who by this time had quite recovered
from her fright, and, as they readily saw,
not wholly of an unpleasant kind. From time
to time she tittered audibly&mdash;a thing which
had never happened before.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as if a tombstone should giggle,&#8221;
remarked Harlan. His tone was low, but
unfortunately, it carried well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tombstone or not, just as you like,&#8221; responded
Mrs. Smithers, as she came in with
the bacon. &#8220;I&#8217;d be careful &#8217;ow I spoke disrespectfully
of tombstones if I was in your
places, that&#8217;s wot I would. Tombstones is
kind to some and cussed to others, that&#8217;s wot
they are, and if you don&#8217;t like the monument
wot&#8217;s at present in your kitchen, you know
wot you can do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>After breakfast, she beckoned Dorothy into
the kitchen, and &#8220;gave notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Smithers,&#8221; cried Dorothy, almost
moved to tears, &#8220;please don&#8217;t leave me
in the lurch! What should I do without you,
with all these people on my hands? Don&#8217;t
think of such a thing as leaving me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carr,&#8221; said Mrs. Smithers, solemnly,
with one long bony finger laid alongside of
her hooked nose, &#8220;&#8217;t ain&#8217;t necessary for you
to run no Summer hotel, that&#8217;s what it ain&#8217;t.
These &#8217;ere all be relations of your uncle&#8217;s wife
and none of his&#8217;n except by marriage. Wot&#8217;s
more, your uncle don&#8217;t want &#8217;em &#8217;ere, that&#8217;s
wot &#8217;e don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s tone was so confident that
for the moment Dorothy was startled, remembering
yesterday&#8217;s vague allusion to &#8220;sheeted
spectres of the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Carr,&#8221; returned Mrs. Smithers, with
due dignity, &#8220;ever since I come &#8217;ere, I&#8217;ve
been invited to shut my &#8217;ead whenever I
opened it about that there cat or your uncle
or anythink, as you well knows. I was never
one wot was fond of &#8217;avin&#8217; my &#8217;ead shut
up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Dorothy, her curiosity fully
alive, &#8220;and tell me what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gives me your solemn oath, Miss,
that you won&#8217;t tell me to shut my &#8217;ead?&#8221;
queried Mrs. Smithers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; returned Dorothy, trying to
be practical, though the atmosphere was
sepulchral enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, you knows wot I told you
about that there cat. &#8217;E was kilt by your
uncle, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e was, and your uncle
couldn&#8217;t never abide cats. &#8217;E was that feared
of &#8217;em &#8217;e couldn&#8217;t even bury &#8217;em when they
was kilt, and one of my duties, Miss, as long
as I lived with &#8217;im, was buryin&#8217; of cats, and
until this one, I never come up with one wot
couldn&#8217;t stay buried, that&#8217;s wot I &#8217;aven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;E &#8217;ated &#8217;em like poison, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e did.
The week afore your uncle died, he kilt this
&#8217;ere cat wot&#8217;s chasin&#8217; the chickens now, and
I buried &#8217;im with my own hands, but could &#8217;e
stay buried? &#8217;E could not. No sooner is
your uncle dead and gone than this &#8217;ere cat
comes back, and it&#8217;s the truth, Miss Carr, for
where &#8217;e was buried, there ain&#8217;t no sign of a
cat now. Wot&#8217;s worse, this &#8217;ere cat looks
per-cisely like your uncle, green eyes, white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
shirt front, black tie and all. It&#8217;s enough to
give a body the shivers to see &#8217;im a-settin&#8217; on
the kitchen floor lappin&#8217; up &#8217;is mush and milk,
the which your uncle was so powerful fond of.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot&#8217;s more,&#8221; continued Mrs. Smithers,
in tones of awe, &#8220;I&#8217;ll a&#8217;most bet my immortal
soul that if you&#8217;ll dig in the cemetery where
your uncle was buried good and proper, you
won&#8217;t find nothin&#8217; but the empty coffin and
maybe &#8217;is grave clothes. Your uncle&#8217;s been
livin&#8217; with us all along in that there cat,&#8221; she
added, triumphantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;is punishment,
for &#8217;e couldn&#8217;t never abide &#8217;em, that&#8217;s wot &#8217;e
couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Carr opened her mouth to speak, then,
remembering her promise, took refuge in
flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Er&#8217;s scared,&#8221; muttered Mrs. Smithers,
&#8220;and no wonder. Wot with cats as can&#8217;t
stay buried, writin&#8217; letters and deliverin&#8217; &#8217;em
in the dead of night, and a purrin&#8217; like mad
while blamed fools digs for eight cents, most
folks would be scared, I take it, that&#8217;s wot
they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy was pale when she went into the
library where Harlan was at work. He
frowned at the interruption and Dorothy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
smiled back at him&mdash;it seemed so normal
and sane.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Dorothy?&#8221; he asked, not
unkindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;just Mrs. Smithers&#8217;s nonsense. She&#8217;s
upset me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about, dear?&#8221; Harlan put his work
aside readily enough now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the same old story about the cat and
Uncle Ebeneezer. And I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s foolish, but I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;s
going to dig in the cemetery to see if Uncle
Ebeneezer is still there. She thinks he&#8217;s in
the cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the moment, Harlan thought Dorothy
had suddenly lost her reason, then he laughed
heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;she won&#8217;t do
anything of the kind, and, besides, what if
she did? It&#8217;s a free country, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;there&#8217;s another thing, Harlan.&#8221;
For days she had dreaded to speak of it, but
now it could be put off no longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s money,&#8221; she went on, unwillingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t managed
very well, or else it&#8217;s cost so much for everything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
but we&#8217;re&mdash;we&#8217;re almost broke, Harlan,&#8221;
she concluded, bravely, trying to smile.</p>
<p>Harlan put his hands in his pockets and
began to walk back and forth. &#8220;If I can only
finish the book,&#8221; he said, at length, &#8220;I think
we&#8217;ll be all right, but I can&#8217;t leave it now.
There&#8217;s only two more chapters to write, and
then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; cried Dorothy, her beautiful
belief in him transfiguring her face, &#8220;then
we&#8217;ll be rich, won&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am already rich,&#8221; returned Harlan,
&#8220;when you have such faith in me as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the shimmering veil of estrangement
which so long had hung between
them, seemed to part, and reveal soul to soul.
As swiftly the mood changed and Dorothy
felt it first, like a chill mist in the air. Neither
dreamed that with the writing of the first
paragraph in the book, the spell had claimed
one of them for ever&mdash;that cobweb after cobweb,
of gossamer fineness, should make a
fabric never to be broken; that on one side of
it should stand a man who had exchanged his
dreams for realities and his realities for dreams,
and on the other, a woman, blindly hurt,
eternally straining to see beyond the veil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; asked Harlan, unwontedly
practical for the nonce.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dorothy. &#8220;There are
the diamonds, you know, that we found. I
don&#8217;t care for any diamonds, except the one
you gave me. If we could sell those&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy, don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re
ours, and if they were, they shouldn&#8217;t be
sold. You should keep them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My engagement ring, then,&#8221; suggested
Dorothy, her lips trembling. &#8220;That&#8217;s ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be foolish,&#8221; said Harlan, a little
roughly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll finish this and then we&#8217;ll see
what&#8217;s to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling her dismissal, Dorothy went out,
and, all unknowingly, straight into the
sunshine.</p>
<p>Elaine was coming downstairs, fresh and
sweet as the morning itself. &#8220;Am I too late
to have any breakfast, Mrs. Carr?&#8221; she asked,
gaily. &#8220;I know I don&#8217;t deserve any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you shall have breakfast. I&#8217;ll
see to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elaine took her place at the table and Dorothy,
reluctant to put further strain on the frail
bond that anchored Mrs. Smithers to her
service, brought in the breakfast herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so good to me,&#8221; said the girl,
gratefully, as Dorothy poured out a cup of
steaming coffee. &#8220;To think how beautiful
you&#8217;ve been to me, when I never saw either
one of you in my whole life, till I came here
ill and broken-hearted! See what you&#8217;ve
made of me&mdash;see how well and strong I
am!&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly, Dorothy bent and kissed Elaine, a
strange, shadowy cloud for ever lifted from
her heart. She had not known how heavy it
was nor how charged with foreboding, until it
was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to do something for you,&#8221; Elaine
went on, laughing to hide the mist in her
eyes, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve just thought what I can do.
My mother had some beautiful old mahogany
furniture, just loads of it, and some wonderful
laces, and I&#8217;m going to divide with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not,&#8221; returned Dorothy,
warmly. She felt that Elaine had already
given her enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t meant for payment, Mrs. Carr,&#8221;
the girl went on, her big blue eyes fixed upon
Dorothy, &#8220;but you&#8217;re to take it from me just
as I&#8217;ve taken this lovely Summer from you.
You took in a stranger, weak and helpless and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
half-crazed with grief, and you&#8217;ve made her
into a happy woman again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Dorothy could answer, Dick lounged
in, frankly sleepy. &#8220;Second call in the dining
car?&#8221; he asked, taking Mrs. Dodd&#8217;s place,
across the table from Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third call,&#8221; returned Dorothy, brightly,
&#8220;and, if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll leave you two to
wait on yourselves.&#8221; She went upstairs, her
heart light, not so much from reality as from
prescience. &#8220;How true it is,&#8221; she thought,
&#8220;that if you only wait and do the best you
can, things all work out straight again. I&#8217;ve
had to learn it, but I know it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully bunch, the Carrs,&#8221; remarked Dick,
pushing his cup to Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re lovely,&#8221; she answered, with
conviction.</p>
<p>The sun streamed brightly into the dining-room
of the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern and changed its
hideousness into cheer. Seeing Elaine across
from him, gracefully pouring his coffee, affected
Dick strangely. Since the day before, he
had seen clearly something which he must do.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Elaine,&#8221; he began, awkwardly.
&#8220;That beast of a poem I read the other
day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>Her face paled, ever so slightly. &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Perkins didn&#8217;t write it, you know,&#8221;
Dick went on, hastily. &#8220;I did it myself.
Or, rather I found it, blowing around, outside,
just as I said, and I fixed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At length he became restless under the calm
scrutiny of Elaine&#8217;s clear eyes. &#8220;I beg your
pardon,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you think,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;that it was
nice to make fun of a lady in that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think,&#8221; returned Dick, truthfully.
&#8220;I never thought for a minute that it was
making fun of you, but only of that&mdash;that pup,
Perkins,&#8221; he concluded, viciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the circumstances,&#8221; said Elaine,
ignoring the epithet, &#8220;the silence of Mr. Perkins
has been very noble. I shall tell him
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do,&#8221; answered Dick, with difficulty.
&#8220;He&#8217;s ambling up to the lunch-counter
now.&#8221; Mr. Chester went out by way of the
window, swallowing hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have just been told,&#8221; said Miss St. Clair to
the poet, &#8220;that the&mdash;er&mdash;poem was not written
by you, and I apologise for what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins bowed in acknowledgment.
&#8220;It is a small matter,&#8221; he said, wearily,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
running his fingers through his hair. It was,
indeed, compared with deep sorrow of a penetrating
kind, and a sleepless night, but Elaine
did not relish the comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were&mdash;were you restless in the night?&#8221;
she asked, conventionally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was. I did not sleep at all until after
four o&#8217;clock, and then only for a few moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Did&mdash;did you write anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I began an epic,&#8221; answered the poet,
touched, for the moment, by this unexpected
sympathy. &#8220;An epic in blank verse, on
&#8216;Disappointment.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s beautiful,&#8221; continued Elaine,
coldly. &#8220;And that reminds me. I have
hunted through my room, in every possible
place, and found nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>A flood of painful emotion overwhelmed
the poet, and he buried his face in his hands.
In a flash, Elaine was violently angry, though
she could not have told why. She marched
out of the dining-room and slammed the door.
&#8220;Delicate, sensitive soul,&#8221; she said to herself,
scornfully. &#8220;Wants people to hunt for money
he thinks may be hidden in his room, and yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
is so far above sordidness that he can&#8217;t hear it
spoken of!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Chester pacing back and forth
moodily at some distance from the house,
Elaine rushed out to him. &#8220;Dick,&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;he <i>is</i> a lobster!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick&#8217;s clouded face brightened. &#8220;Is he?&#8221;
he asked, eagerly, knowing instinctively
whom she meant. &#8220;Elaine, you&#8217;re a brick!&#8221;
They shook hands in token of absolute agreement
upon one subject at least, and the girl&#8217;s
right hand hurt her for some little time
afterward.</p>
<p>Left to himself, Mr. Perkins mused upon
the dread prospect before him. For years he
had calculated upon a generous proportion
of his Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s estate, and had even
borrowed money upon the strength of his
expectations. These debts now loomed up
inconveniently.</p>
<p>The vulgar, commercial people from whom
Mr. Perkins had borrowed filthy coin were
quite capable of speaking of the matter, and
in an unpleasant manner at that. The fine
soul of Mr. Perkins shrank from the ordeal.
He had that particular disdain of commercialism
which is inseparable from the incapable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
and unsuccessful, and yet, if the light of his
genius were to illuminate a desolate world,
Mr. Perkins must have money.</p>
<p>He might even have to degrade himself by
coarse toil&mdash;and hitherto, he had been too
proud to work. The thought was terrible.
Pegasus hitched to the plough was nothing
compared with the prospect of Mr. Perkins
being obliged to earn three or four dollars a
week in some humble, common capacity.</p>
<p>Then a bright idea came to his rescue.
&#8220;Mr. Carr,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;the gentleman who
is now entertaining me&mdash;he is doing my own
kind of work, though of course it is less fine
in quality. Perhaps he would like the opportunity
of going down to posterity as the
humble Mæcenas of a new Horace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Borne to the library in the rush of this attractive
idea, Mr. Perkins opened the door,
which Harlan had forgotten to lock, and without
in any way announcing himself, broke in
on Harlan&#8217;s chapter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded the
irate author. &#8220;What business have you butting
in here like this? Get out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&#8221; stammered Mr. Perkins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; thundered Harlan. It sounded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
strangely like the last phrase of &#8220;dear Uncle
Ebeneezer&#8217;s last communication,&#8221; and, trembling,
the disconsolate poet obeyed. He fled
to his own room as a storm-tossed ship to its
last harbour, and renewed the composition of
his epic on &#8220;Disappointment,&#8221; for which, by
this time, he had additional material.</p>
<p>Harlan went back to his work, but the
mood was gone. The living, radiant picture
had wholly vanished, and in its place was a
heap of dead, dry, meaningless words. &#8220;Did
I write it?&#8221; asked Harlan, of himself, &#8220;and
if so, why?&#8221;</p>
<p>Like the mocking fantasy of a dream as seen
in the instant of waking, Elaine and her company
had gone, as if to return no more. Only
two chapters were yet to be written, and he
knew, vaguely, what Elaine was about to do
when he left her, but his pen had lost the
trick of writing.</p>
<p>Deeply troubled, Harlan went to the window,
where the outer world still had the curious
appearance of unreality. It was as though
a sheet of glass were between him and the
life of the rest of the world. He could see
through it clearly, but the barrier was there,
and must always be there. Upon the edge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
of this glass, the light of life should break and
resolve itself into prismatic colours, of which
he should see one at a time, now and then
more, and often a clear, pitiless view of the
world should give him no colour at all.</p>
<p>Presently Lawyer Bradford came up the hill,
dressed for a formal call. In a flash it brought
back to Harlan the day the old man had first
come to the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern, when Dorothy
was a happy girl with a care-free boy for a
husband. How much had happened since,
and how old and grey the world had grown!</p>
<p>&#8220;I desire to see the distinguished author,
Mr. Carr,&#8221; the thin, piping voice was saying
at the door, &#8220;upon a matter of immediate
and personal importance. And Mrs. Carr
also, if she is at leisure. Privacy is absolutely
essential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into the library,&#8221; said Harlan, from
the doorway. Another interruption made
no difference now. Dorothy soon followed,
much mystified by the way in which Mrs.
Smithers had summoned her.</p>
<p>Remembering the inopportune intrusion of
Mr. Perkins, Harlan locked the door. &#8220;Now,
Mr. Bradford,&#8221; he said, easily, &#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have told you before,&#8221; began the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
old lawyer, &#8220;had not the bonds of silence
been laid upon me by one whom we all revere
and who is now past carrying out his own
desires. The house is yours, as my letters of
an earlier date apprised you, and the will is to
be probated at the Fall term of court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your uncle,&#8221; went on Mr. Bradford, unwillingly,
&#8220;was a great sufferer from&mdash;from
relations,&#8221; he added, lowering his voice to a
shrill whisper, &#8220;and he has chosen to revenge
himself for his sufferings in his own way.
Of this I am not at liberty to speak, though
no definite silence was required of me later
than yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, however, a farm of two thousand
acres, all improved, which is still to come
to you, and a sum of money amounting to
something over ten thousand dollars, in the
bank to your credit. The multitudinous duties
in connection with the practice of my profession
have prevented me from making myself
familiar with the exact amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; he went on, looking at Dorothy,
&#8220;there is a very beautiful diamond pin, the
gift of my lamented friend to his lovely young
wife upon the day of the solemnisation of their
nuptials, which was to be given to the wife of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
Mr. Judson&#8217;s nephew when he should marry.
It is sewn in a mattress in the room at the end
of the north wing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The earth whirled beneath Dorothy&#8217;s feet.
At first, she had not fully comprehended what
Mr. Bradford was saying, but now she realised
that they had passed from pinching poverty
to affluence&mdash;at least it seemed so to her.
Harlan was not so readily confused, but none
the less, he, too, was dazed. Neither of them
could speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be grateful,&#8221; the old man was
saying, &#8220;if you would ask Mr. Richard Chester
and Mrs. Sarah Smithers to come to my
office at their earliest convenience. I will not
trespass upon their valuable time at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long silence, during which Mr.
Bradford cleared his throat, and wiped his
glasses several times. &#8220;The farm has always
been held in my name,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;to
protect our lamented friend and benefactor
from additional disturbance. If&mdash;if the relations
had known, his life would have been
even less peaceful than it was. A further farm,
valued at twelve thousand dollars, and also
held in my name, is my friend&#8217;s last gift to
me, as I discovered by opening a personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
letter which was to be kept sealed until this
morning. I did not open it until late in the
morning, not wishing to show unseemly
eagerness to pry into my friend&#8217;s affairs. I
am too much affected to speak of it&mdash;I feel
his loss too keenly. He was my Colonel&mdash;I
served under him in the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mist filled the old man&#8217;s eyes and he
fumbled for the door-knob. Harlan found it
for him, turned the key, and opened the door.
Mrs. Dodd, Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. Smithers, and
the suffering poet were all in the hall, their
attitudes plainly indicating that they had been
listening at the door, but something in Mr.
Bradford&#8217;s face made them huddle back into
the corner, ashamed.</p>
<p>Feeling his way with his cane, he went to
the parlour door, where he stood for a moment
at the threshold, his streaming eyes
fixed upon the portrait over the mantel. The
simple dignity of his grief forbade a word
from any one. At length he straightened himself,
brought his trembling hand to his forehead
in a feeble military salute, and, wiping
his eyes, tottered off downhill.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>The Lady Elaine knows her Heart</h3>
</div>

<p><i>It was on a dark and stormy midnight, when
the thunders boomed and the dread fury of
the lightnings scarred the overhanging cliffs,
that the Lady Elaine at last came to know her
heart.</i></p>
<p><i>She was in a cave, safe from all but the
noise of the storm. A cheery fire blazed at
her door, and her bed within was made soft
with pine boughs and skins. For weeks they
had journeyed here and there, yet there had
been no knight in whose face Elaine could find
what she sought.</i></p>
<p><i>As she lay on her couch, she reflected upon
the faithful wayfarers who had travelled with
her, who had ever been gentle and courtly,
saving her from all annoyance and all harm.
Yet above them all, there was one who, from
the time of their starting, had kept vigilant
guard. He was the humblest of them all, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
it was he who made her rest in shady places by
the wayside when she herself scarce knew that
she was weary; had given her cool spring water
in a cup cunningly woven of leaves before she
had realised her thirst; had brought her berries
and strange, luscious fruits before she had
thought of hunger; and who had cheered her,
many a time, when no one else had guessed
that she was sad.</i></p>
<p><i>Outside, he was guarding her now, all heedless
of the rain. She could see him dimly in
the shadow, then, all at once, more clearly in
the firelight. His head was bowed and his
arms folded, yet in the strong lines of his
body there was no hint of weariness. Well
did the Lady Elaine know that until Dawn spun
her web of enchantment upon the mysterious
loom of the East, he would march sleeplessly
before her door, replenishing the fire, listening
now and then for her deep breathing,
and, upon the morrow, gaily tell her of his
dreams.</i></p>
<p><i>Dreams they were, indeed, but not the dreams
of sleep. Upon these midnight marchings,
her sentinel gave his wandering fancy free
rein. And because of the dumb pain in his
heart, these fancies were all the merrier;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
more golden with the sun of laughter, more
gemmed with the pearl of tears.</i></p>
<p><i>Proud-hearted, yet strangely homesick, the
Lady Elaine was restless this night. &#8220;I must
go back,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;to the Castle of Content,
where my dear father would fain have
his child again. And yet I dread to go back
with my errand undone, my quest unrewarded.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;What is it,&#8221; thought Elaine, in sudden
self-searching, &#8220;that I seek? What must
this man be, to whom I would surrender the
keeping of my heart? What do I ask that is
so hard to find?</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Am I seeking for a god? Nay, surely not,
but only for a man. Valorous he must be, indeed,
but not in the lists&mdash;&#8217;tis not a soldier,
for I have seen them by the hundred since
I left my home in the valley. &#8217;Tis not a
model for the tapestry weaver that my heart
would have, for I have seen the most beautiful
youths of my country since I came forth upon
my quest.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Some one, perchance,&#8221; mused the Lady
Elaine, &#8220;whose beauty my eyes alone should
perceive, whose valour only I should guess
before there was need to test it. Some one great
of heart and clean of mind, in whose eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
there should never be that which makes a
woman ashamed. Some one fine-fibred and
strong-souled, not above tenderness when a
maid was tired. One who should make a
shield of his love, to keep her not only from
the great hurts but from the little ones as
well, and yet with whom she might fare
onward, shoulder to shoulder, as God meant
mates should fare.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Surely &#8217;tis not so unusual, this thing that
I ask&mdash;only an honest man with human faults
and human virtues, transfigured by a great
love. And why is it that in this quest of mine,
I have found him not?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Princess,&#8221; said a voice at her doorway,
&#8220;thou art surely still awake. The storm is
lessening and there is naught to fear. I pray
thee, try to sleep. And if there is aught I
can do for thee, thou knowest thou hast only
to speak.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>From the warm darkness where she lay,
Elaine saw his face with the firelight upon it,
and all at once she knew.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;There is naught,&#8221; she answered, with
what he thought was coldness. &#8220;I bid thee
leave me and take thine own rest.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;As thou wilt,&#8221; he responded, submissively,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
but though the sound was now faint
and far away, she still could hear him walking
back and forth, keeping his unremitting
guard.</i></p>
<p><i>So it was that at last Love came to the Lady
Elaine. She had dreamed of some fair
stranger, into whose eyes she should look and
instantly know him for her lord, never guessing
that her lord had gone with her when she
left the Castle of Content. There was none
of those leaps of the heart of which one of
the maids at the Castle had read from the
books while the others worked at the tapestry
frames. It was nothing new, but only a light
upon something which had always been, and
which, because of her own blindness, she had
not seen.</i></p>
<p><i>All through this foolish journey, Love had
ridden beside the Lady Elaine, asking nothing
but the privilege of serving her; demanding
only the right to give, to sacrifice, to shield.
And at last she knew.</i></p>
<p><i>The doubting in her heart was for ever
stilled and in its place was a great peace.
There was an unspeakable tenderness and a
measureless compassion, so wide and so deep
that it sheltered all the world. For, strangely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
enough, the love of the many comes first
through the love of the one.</i></p>
<p><i>The Lady Elaine did not need to ask whether
he loved her, for, unerringly, she knew. Mated
past all power of change, they two were one
henceforward, though seas should roll between.
Mated through suffering as well, for, in this
new bond, as the Lady Elaine dimly perceived,
there was great possibility of hurt. Yet there
was no end or no beginning; it simply was, and
at last she knew.</i></p>
<p><i>At length, she slept. When she awoke the
morning was fair upon the mountains, but
still he paced back and forth before her door.
Rising, she bathed her face in the cool water
he had brought her, braided her glorious
golden hair, changed her soiled habit for a
fresh robe of white satin traced with gold,
donned her red embroidered slippers, and
stepped out into the sunrise, shading her eyes
with her hand until they grew accustomed to
the dawn.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Good morrow, Princess,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Of a sudden, he stopped and fled like a
wild thing into the forest, for by her eyes, he
saw what was in her heart, and his hot words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
struggling for utterance, choked him. &#8220;At
last,&#8221; he breathed, with his clenched hands
on his breast; &#8220;at last&mdash;but no, &#8217;tis another
dream of mine that I dare not believe.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>His senses reeled, for love comes not to a
man as to a woman, but rather with the sound
of trumpets and the glare of white light. The
cloistered peace that fills her soul rests seldom
upon him, and instead he is stirred with high
ambition and spurred on to glorious achievement.
For to her, love is the end of life; to
him it is the means.</i></p>
<p><i>The knights thought it but another caprice
when the Lady Elaine gave orders to return to
the Castle of Content, at once, and by the
shortest way&mdash;all save one of them. With
his heart rioting madly through his breast, he
knew, but he did not dare to look at Elaine.
He was as one long blinded, who suddenly sees
the sun.</i></p>
<p><i>So it was that though he still served her, he
rode no longer by her side, and Elaine, hurt
at first, at length understood, and smiled
because of her understanding. All the way
back, the Lady Elaine sang little songs to herself,
and, the while she rode upon her palfrey,
touched her zither into gentle harmonies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
After many days, they came within sight of
the Castle of Content.</i></p>
<p><i>As before, it was sunset, and the long light
lay upon the hills, while the valley was in
shadow. Purple were the  vineyards, heavy
with their clustered treasure, over which the
tiny weavers had made their lace, and purple,
too, were the many-spired cliffs, behind which
the sunset shone.</i></p>
<p><i>A courier, riding swiftly in advance, had
apprised the Lord of the Castle of Content
of the return of the Lady Elaine, and the
maids from the tapestry room, and the keeper
of the wine-cellar, and the stable-boys, and
the candle-makers, and the light-bearers all
rushed out, heedless of their manners, for,
one and all, they loved the Lady Elaine, and
were eager to behold their beautiful mistress
again.</i></p>
<p><i>But the Lord of the Castle of Content, speaking
somewhat sternly, ordered them one and
all back to their places, and, shamefacedly,
they obeyed. &#8220;I would not be selfish,&#8221; he
muttered to himself, &#8220;but surely, Elaine is
mine, and the first gleam of her beauty belongs
of right to these misty old eyes of mine, that
have long strained across the dark for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
first hint of her coming. Of a truth her
quest has been long.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>So it came to pass that when the company
reached the road that led down into the valley,
the Lord of the Castle of Content was on
the portico alone, though he could not have
known that behind every shuttered window of
the Castle, a humble servitor of Elaine&#8217;s was
waiting anxiously for her coming.</i></p>
<p><i>As before, Elaine rode at the head, waving
her hand to her father, while the cymbals
and the bugles crashed out a welcome. She
could not see, but she guessed that he was
there, and in return he waved a tremulous
hand at her, though well he knew that in the
fast gathering twilight, the child of his heart
could not see the one who awaited her.</i></p>
<p><i>One by one, as they came in single file down
the precipice, the old man counted them, much
astonished to see that there was no new member
of the company&mdash;that as many were coming
back as had gone away. For the moment his
heart was glad, then he reproached himself
bitterly for his selfishness, and was truthfully
most tender toward Elaine, because she had
failed upon her quest.</i></p>
<p><i>The light gleamed capriciously upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
bauble of the fool, which he still carried,
though now it hung downward from his
saddle, foolishly enough. &#8220;A most merry
fool,&#8221; said the Lord of Content to himself.
&#8220;I was wise to insist upon his accompanying
this wayward child of mine.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>Wayward she might be, yet her father&#8217;s
eyes were dim when she came down into the
valley, where there was no light save the
evening star, a taper light at an upper window
of the Castle, and her illumined face.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;How hast thou fared upon thy quest,
Elaine?&#8221; he asked in trembling tones, when
at last she released herself from his eager
embrace. He dreaded to hear her make known
her disappointment, yet his sorrow was all for
her, and not in the least for himself.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;I have found him, father,&#8221; she said, the
gladness in her voice betraying itself as surely
as the music in a stream when Spring sets it
free again, &#8220;and, forsooth, he rode with me
all the time.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Which knight hast thou chosen, Elaine?&#8221;
he asked, a little sadly.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;No knight at all, dear father. I have
found my knight in stranger guise than in
armour and shield. He bears no lance, save
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
for those who would injure me.&#8221; And then,
she beckoned to the fool.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;He is here, my father,&#8221; she went on, her
great love making her all unconscious of the
shame she should feel.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Elaine!&#8221; thundered her father, while
the fool hung his head, &#8220;hast thou taken
leave of thy senses? Of a truth, this is a
sorry jest thou hast chosen to greet me with
on thy return.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Elaine, made bold by the
silent pressure of the hand that secretly
clasped hers, &#8220;&#8217;tis no jest. If thou art
pained, indeed I am sorry, but if thou choosest
to banish me, then this night will I go gladly
with him I have chosen to be my lord. The
true heart which Heaven has sent for me beats
beneath his motley, and with him I must go.
Dear father,&#8221; cried Elaine, piteously, &#8220;do
not send us away!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>The stern eyes of the Lord of the Castle of
Content were fixed upon the fool, and in
the gathering darkness they gleamed like live
coals. &#8220;And thou,&#8221; he said, scornfully;
&#8220;what hast thou to say?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Only this,&#8221; answered the fool; &#8220;that the
Princess has spoken truly. We are mated by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
a higher law than that of thy land or mine,
and &#8217;tis this law that we must obey. If thou
sayest the word, we will set forth to my country
this very night, though we are both weary with
much journeying.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Thy land,&#8221; said the Lord of the Castle,
with measureless contempt, &#8220;and what land
hast thou? Even the six feet of ground thou
needest for a grave must be given thee at the
last, unless, perchance, thou hast a handful
of stolen earth hidden somewhere among thy
other jewels!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Your lordship,&#8221; cried the fool, with a
clear ring in his voice, &#8220;thou shall not speak
so to the man who is to wed thy daughter. I
had not thought to tell even her till after the
priests had made us one, but for our own protection,
I am stung into speech.</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Know then, that I am no fool, but a Prince
of the House of Bernard. My acres and my
vineyards cover five times the space of this
little realm of thine. Chests of gold and
jewels I have, storehouses overflowing with
grain and fine fabrics, three castles and a
royal retinue. Of a truth, thou art blind
since thou canst see naught but the raiment.
May not a Prince wear motley if he chooses,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
thus to find a maid who will love him for
himself alone?&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>&#8220;Prince Bernard,&#8221; muttered the Lord of
Content, &#8220;the son of my old friend, whom I
have long dreamed in secret shouldst wed my
dear daughter Elaine! Your Highness, I beg
you to forgive me, and to take my hand.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>But Prince Bernard did not hear, nor see
the outstretched hand, for Elaine was in his
arms for the first time, her sweet lips close on
his. &#8220;My Prince, oh my Prince,&#8221; she murmured,
when at length he set her free; &#8220;my
eyes could not see, but my heart knew!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>So ended the Quest of the Lady Elaine.</i></p>
<p>With a sigh, Harlan wrote the last words
and pushed the paper from him, staring
blankly at the wall and seeing nothing. His
labour was at an end, all save the final copying,
and the painstaking daily revision which
would take weeks longer. The exaltation he
had expected to be conscious of was utterly
absent; instead of it, he had a sense of loss,
of change.</p>
<p>His surroundings seemed hopelessly sordid
and ugly, now that the glow was gone. All
unknowingly, when Harlan pencilled: &#8220;The
End,&#8221; in fanciful letters at the bottom of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
last page, he had had practically his last joy of
his book. The torturing process of revision
was to take all the life out of it. Sentences
born of surging emotion would seem vapid
and foolish when subjected to the cold, critical
eye of his reason, yet he knew, dimly, that he
must not change it too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let it get cool,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;before I
do anything more to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet, now, it was difficult to stop working.
The rented typewriter, with its enticing
bank of keys, was close at hand. A thousand
sheets of paper and a box of carbon waited in
the drawer of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s desk. His
worn <i>Thesaurus of English Words and
Phrases</i> was at his elbow. And they were
poor. Then Harlan laughed, for they were no
longer poor, and he had wholly forgotten it.</p>
<p>There was a step upon the porch outside,
then Dorothy came into the hall. She paused
outside the library door for a moment, ostensibly
to tie her shoe, but in reality to listen.
A wave of remorseful tenderness overwhelmed
Harlan and he unlocked the door.
&#8220;Come in,&#8221; he said, smiling. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t
be afraid to come in any more. The book is
all done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>&#8220;O Harlan, is it truly done?&#8221; There
was no gladness in her voice, only relief.
Doubt was in every intonation of her sentence;
incredulity in every line of her body.</p>
<p>With this pitiless new insight of his, Harlan
saw how she had felt for these last weeks and
became very tenderly anxious not to hurt her;
to shield his transformed self from her quick
understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Have I been a
beast, Dorothy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question was so like the boy she used
to know that her heart leaped wildly, then
became portentously still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; she admitted, grudgingly, from
the shelter of his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. If you say so, I&#8217;ll burn it.
Nothing is coming between you and me.&#8221;
The words sounded hollow and meaningless,
as he knew they were.</p>
<p>She put her hand over his mouth. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t do any such thing,&#8221; she said. Dorothy
had learned the bitterness of the woman&#8217;s
part, to stand by, utterly lonely, and dream,
and wait, while men achieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I read it now?&#8221; she asked, timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t make it out, Dorothy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
When it&#8217;s all done, and every word is just as
I want it, I&#8217;ll read it to you. That will be
better, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can Dick come, too?&#8221; She asked the
question thoughtlessly, then flushed as Harlan
took her face between his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy, did you know Dick before we
were married?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Harlan! I never saw him in all my
life till the day he came here. Did you think
I had?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan only grunted, but she understood,
and, in return, asked her question. &#8220;Did
you write the book about Elaine?&#8221; she began,
half ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear little idiot,&#8221; said Harlan, softly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d begun the book before she came or
before I knew she was coming. I never saw
her till she came to live with us. You&#8217;re
foolish, dearest, don&#8217;t you think you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was swiftly perceiving the necessity of
creating a new harmony to take the place
of that old one, now so strangely lost.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two of us,&#8221; returned Dorothy,
with conviction, wiping her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d ask me things,&#8221; said Harlan,
a little later. &#8220;I&#8217;m no mind reader.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
And, besides, the seventh son of a seventh
son, born with a caul, and having three
trances regularly every day after meals, never
could hope to understand a woman unless
she was willing to help him out a little,
occasionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which, after all, was more or less true.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s Diary</h3>
</div>

<p>Harlan had taken his work upstairs,
that the ceaseless clatter of the typewriter
might not add to the confusion which
normally prevailed in the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern.
Thus it happened that Dorothy was able to
begin her long-cherished project of dusting,
rearranging, and cataloguing the books.</p>
<p>There is a fine spiritual essence which exhales
from the covers of a book. Shall one
touch a copy of Shakespeare with other than
reverent hands, or take up his Boswell without
a smile? Through the worn covers and
broken binding the master-spirit still speaks,
no less than through the centuries which lie
between. The man who had the wishing
carpet, upon which he sat and wished and
was thence immediately transported to the
ends of the earth, was not possessed of a finer
magic than one who takes his Boswell in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
hands and then, for a golden quarter of an
hour, lives in a bygone London with Doctor
Johnson.</p>
<p>When the book-lover enters his library, no
matter what storm and tumult may be in his
heart, he has come to the inmost chamber of
Peace. The indescribable, musty odour which
breathes from the printed page is fragrant incense
to him who loves his books. In unseemly
caskets his treasures may be hidden,
yet, when the cover is reverently lifted, the
jewels shine with no fading light. The old,
immortal beauty is still there, for any one who
seeks it in the right way.</p>
<p>Dorothy had two willing assistants in Dick
and Elaine. One morning, immediately after
breakfast, the three went to the library and
locked the door. Outside, the twins rioted
unheeded and the perennially joyous Willie
capered unceasingly. Mr. Perkins, gloomy
and morose, wrote reams of poetry in his
own room, distressed beyond measure by the
rumble of the typewriter, but too much cast
down to demand that it be stopped.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dodd and Mrs. Holmes, closely united
through misfortune, were well-nigh inseparable
now, while Mrs. Smithers, still sepulchral,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
sang continually in a loud, cracked voice,
never by any chance happening upon the
right note. As Dorothy said, when there are
only eight tones in the octave, it would seem
that sometime, somewhere, a warbler must
coincide for a brief interval with the tune,
but as Dick further commented, industry
and patience can do wonders when rightly
exercised.</p>
<p>Uncle Israel&#8217;s midnight excursion to the
orchard had given him a fresh attack of a
familiar and distressing ailment to which he
always alluded as &#8220;the brown kittys.&#8221; Fortunately,
however, the cure for asthma and
bronchitis was contained in the same quart
bottle, and needed only to be heated in
order to work upon both diseases simultaneously.</p>
<p>Elaine rolled up the sleeves of her white
shirt-waist, and turned in her collar, thereby
producing an effect which Dick privately considered
distractingly pretty. Dorothy was enveloped
from head to foot in a voluminous blue
gingham apron, and a dust cap, airily poised
upon her smooth brown hair, completed a
most becoming costume. Dick, having duly
obtained permission, took off his coat and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
on his hat, after which the library force was
ready for action.</p>
<p>&#8220;First,&#8221; said Dorothy, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take down
all the books.&#8221; It sounded simple, but it
took a good share of the day to do it, and
the clouds of dust disturbed by the process
produced sneezes which put Uncle Israel&#8217;s
feeble efforts to shame. When dusting the
shelves, after they were empty, Elaine came
upon a panel in the wall which slid back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a secret drawer!&#8221; she cried, in
wild delight. &#8220;How perfectly lovely! Do
you suppose there&#8217;s anything in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dorothy instantly thought of money and
diamonds, but the concealed treasure proved
to be merely a book. It was a respectable
volume, however, at least as far as size was
concerned, for Elaine and Dorothy together
could scarcely lift it.</p>
<p>It was a leather-bound ledger, of the most
ponderous kind, and was fastened with a lock
and key. The key, of course, was missing,
but Dick soon pried open the fastening.</p>
<p>All but the last few pages in the book were
covered with fine writing, in ink which was
brown and faded, but still legible. It was
Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s penmanship throughout,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
except for a few entries at the beginning, in
a fine, flowing feminine hand, which Dorothy
instantly knew was Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the night of our wedding,&#8221; the book
began, &#8220;we begin this record of our lives,
for until to-day we have not truly lived.&#8221;
This was signed by both. Then, in the
woman&#8217;s hand, was written a description
of her wedding-gown, which was a simple
white muslin, made by herself. Her ornaments
were set down briefly&mdash;only a wreath
of roses in her hair, a string of coral beads,
and the diamond brooch which was at that
moment in Dorothy&#8217;s jewel-box.</p>
<p>For three weeks there were alternate entries,
then suddenly, without date, were two words
so badly written as to be scarcely readable:
&#8220;She died.&#8221; For days thereafter was only
this: &#8220;I cannot write.&#8221; These simple words
were the key to a world of pain, for the pages
were blistered with a man&#8217;s hot tears.</p>
<p>Then came this: &#8220;She would want me to
go on writing it, so I will, though I have no
heart for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>From thence onward the book proceeded
without interruption, a minute and faithful
record of the man&#8217;s inner life. Long extracts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
copied from books filled page after page of
this strange diary, interspersed with records
of business transactions, of letters received
and answered, of wages paid, and of the
visits of Jeremiah Bradford.</p>
<p>&#8220;We talked long to-night upon the immortality
of the soul,&#8221; one entry ran. &#8220;Jeremiah
does not believe it, but I must&mdash;or die.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick soon lost interest in the book, and
finding solitary toil at the shelves uncongenial,
went out, whistling. Elaine and Dorothy
read on together, scarcely noting his absence.</p>
<p>The book had begun in the Spring. Early
in June was chronicled the arrival of &#8220;a
woman calling herself Cousin Elmira, blood
relation of my Rebecca. Was not aware
my Rebecca had a blood relation named
Elmira, but there is much in the world that I
do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the diary, Cousin Elmira had
remained six weeks and had greatly distressed
her unwilling host. &#8220;Women are peculiar,&#8221;
Uncle Ebeneezer had written, &#8220;all being
possessed of the devil, except my sainted
Rebecca, who was an angel if there ever
was one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin Elmira is a curious woman. To-day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
she desired to know what had become of
my Rebecca&#8217;s wedding garments, her linen
sheets and table-cloths. Answered that I did
not know, and immediately put a lock upon
the chest containing them. Have always been
truthful up to now, but Rebecca would not
desire to have any blood relation handling her
sheets. Of this I am sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aug. 9. To-day came Cousin Silas Martin
and his wife to spend their honeymoon.
Much grieved to hear of Rebecca&#8217;s death.
Said she had invited them to spend their
honeymoon with her when they married.
Did not know of this, but our happiness was
of such short duration that my Rebecca did
not have time to tell me of all her wishes.
Company is very hard to bear, but I would do
much for my Rebecca.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aug. 10. This world can never be perfect
under any circumstances, and trials are
the common lot of humanity. We must all
endeavour to bear up under affliction. Sarah
Smithers is a good woman, most faithful, and
does not talk a great deal, considering her
sex. Not intending any reflection upon my
Rebecca, whose sweet voice I could never
hear too often.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Aug. 20. Came Uncle Israel Skiles with
a bad cough. Thinks the air of Judson
Centre must be considered healthy as they are
to build a sanitarium here. Did not know of
the sanitarium.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Aug. 22. Came Cousin Betsey Skiles to
look after Uncle Israel. Uncle Israel not
desiring to be looked after has produced some
disturbance in my house.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Aug. 23. Cousin Betsey Skiles and Cousin
Jane Wood, the latter arriving unexpectedly
this morning, have fought, and Cousin Jane
has gone away again. Had never met Cousin
Jane Wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aug. 24. Was set upon by Cousin Silas
Martin, demanding to know whether his wife
was to be insulted by Cousin Betsey Skiles.
Answered that I did not know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aug. 25. Was obliged to settle a dispute
between Sarah Smithers and Cousin Betsey
Skiles. Decided in favour of S. S., thereby
angering B. S. Uncle Israel accidentally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
spilled his tonic on Cousin Betsey&#8217;s clean
apron. Much disturbance in my house.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Aug. 28. Cousin Silas Martin and wife
went away, telling me they could no longer
live with Cousin Betsey Skiles. B. S. is
unpleasant, but has her virtues.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Sept. 5. Uncle Israel thinks air of Judson
Centre is now too chilly for his cough. Does
not like his bed, considering it drafty. Says
Sarah Smithers does not give him nourishing
food.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Sept. 8. Uncle Israel has gone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Sept. 10. Cousin Betsey Skiles has gone
to continue looking after Uncle Israel. Sarah
Smithers and myself now alone in peace.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>All that Winter, the writing was of books,
interspersed with occasional business details.
In the Spring, the influx of blood relations
began again and continued until Fall. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
diary revealed the gradual transformation of a
sunny disposition into a dark one, of a man
with gregarious instincts into a wild beast
asking only for solitude. Additions to the
house were chronicled from time to time,
with now and then a pathetic comment upon
the futility of the additions.</p>
<p>Once there was this item: &#8220;Would go
away for ever were it not that this was my
Rebecca&#8217;s home. Where we had hoped to
be so happy, there is now a great emptiness
and unnumbered Relations. How shall I endure
Relations? Still they are all of her blood,
though the most gentle blood does seem to
take strange turns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again: &#8220;Do not think my Rebecca would
desire to have all her kin visit her at once.
Still, would do anything for my Rebecca.
Have ordered five more beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the years went by, the bitterness became
more and more apparent. Long before
the end, the record was frankly profane, and
saddest of all was the evidence that under the
stress of annoyance the great love for &#8220;my
Rebecca&#8221; was slowly, but surely, becoming
tainted. From simple profanity, Uncle Ebeneezer
descended into blasphemous comment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
modified at times by remorseful tenderness
toward the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;under pressure of
my questioning, Sister-in-law Fanny Wood
admitted that Rebecca had never invited her
to come and see her. Asked Sister-in-law
why she was here. Responded that Rebecca
would have asked her if she had lived. Perhaps
others have surmised the same. Fear
of late I may have been unjust to my
Rebecca.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later on, &#8220;my Rebecca&#8221; was mentioned
but rarely. She became &#8220;my dear companion,&#8221;
&#8220;my wife,&#8221; or &#8220;my partner.&#8221; The
building of wings and the purchase of additional
beds by this time had become a
permanent feature, though, as the writer admitted,
it was &#8220;a roundabout way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The easiest way would be to turn all out.
Forgetting my duty to the memory of my
dear companion, and sore pressed by many
annoyances, did turn out Cousin Betsey
Skiles, who forgave me for it without being
so requested, and remained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trains to Judson Centre,&#8221; he wrote,
at one time, &#8220;have been most grievously
changed. One arrives just after breakfast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
the other at three in the morning. Do not
understand why this is, and anticipate new
trouble from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entries farther on were full of
&#8220;trouble,&#8221; being minute and intimate portrayals
of the emotions of one roused from
sleep at three in the morning to admit undesired
guests, interlarded with pardonable profanity.
&#8220;Seems that house might be altered
in some way, but do not know. Will consult
with Jeremiah.&#8221;</p>
<p>After this came the record of an interview
with the village carpenter, and rough sketches
of proposed alterations. &#8220;Putting in new
window in middle and making two upper
windows round instead of square, with new
porch-railing and two new narrow windows
downstairs will do it. House fortunately
planned by original architect for such alteration.
Taking down curtains and keeping
lights in windows nights should have some
effect, though much doubt whether anything
would affect Relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Soon afterward the oppressed one chronicled
with great glee how a lone female,
arriving on the night train, was found half-dead
from fright by the roadside in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
morning. &#8220;House <i>is</i> fearsome,&#8221; wrote Uncle
Ebeneezer, with evident relish. &#8220;Have been
to Jeremiah&#8217;s of an evening and, returning,
found it wonderful to behold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, Dorothy came to an intimate analysis
of some of the uninvited ones at present
under her roof. The poet was given a full
page of scathing comment, illustrated by rude
caricatures, which were so suggestive that
even Elaine thoroughly enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Pleased with his contribution to literature,
Uncle Ebeneezer had written a long and
keenly comprehensive essay upon each relation.
These bits of vivid portraiture were
numbered in this way: &#8220;Relation Number 8,
Miss Betsey Skiles, Claiming to be Cousin.&#8221;
At the end of this series was a very beautiful
tribute to &#8220;My Dearly Beloved Nephew,
James Harlan Carr, Who Has Never Come to
See Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frequently, thereafter, came pathetic references
to &#8220;Dear Nephew James,&#8221; &#8220;Unknown
Recipient of an Old Man&#8217;s Gratitude,&#8221; &#8220;Discerning
and Admirable James,&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p>One entry ran as follows: &#8220;Have been approached
this season by each Relation present
in regard to disposal of my estate. Will fix
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
surprise for all Relations before leaving to join
my wife. Shall leave money to every one,
though perhaps not as much as each expects.
Jeremiah advises me to leave something to
each. Laws are such, I believe, that no one
remembered can claim more. Desire to be
just, but strongly incline to dear Nephew
James.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the last page of all was a significant
paragraph. &#8220;Dreamed of seeing my Rebecca
once more, who told me we should be
together again April 7th. Shall make all arrangements
for leaving on that day, and
prepare Surprises spoken of. Shall be very
quiet in my grave with no Relations at hand,
but should like to hear and see effect of Surprise.
Jeremiah will attend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last lines were written on April sixth.
&#8220;To-morrow I shall join my loved Rebecca
and leave all Relations here to fight by themselves.
Do not fear Death, but shudder at
Relations. Relations keep life from being
pleasant. Did not know my Rebecca was
possessed of such numbers nor of such kinds,
but forgive her all. Shall see her to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, on the line below, in a hand that did
not falter, was written: &#8220;The End.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>Dorothy wiped her eyes on a corner of
Elaine&#8217;s apron, for Uncle Ebeneezer had been
found dead in his bed on the morning of
April seventh. &#8220;Elaine,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what
would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do?&#8221; repeated Elaine. &#8220;I&#8217;d strike one
blow for poor old Uncle Ebeneezer! I&#8217;d order
every single one of them out of the house
to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night!&#8221; cried Dorothy, fired with high
resolve. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it this very night! Poor
old Uncle Ebeneezer! Our sufferings have
been nothing, compared to his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to tell Mr. Carr?&#8221; asked
Elaine, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him nothing,&#8221; rejoined Dorothy, with
spirit. &#8220;He&#8217;s got some old fogy notions about
your house being a sacred spot where everybody
in creation can impose on you if they
want to, just because it is your house. I
suppose he got it by being related to poor old
uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to go, too?&#8221; queried Elaine,
rubbing her soft cheek against Dorothy&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; answered Mrs. Carr, with a
sisterly embrace. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stay, and Dick &#8217;ll
stay, and that old tombstone in the kitchen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
will stay, and so will Claudius Tiberius, but
the rest&mdash;MOVE!&#8221;</p>
<p>Consequently, Elaine looked forward to the
dinner-hour with mixed anticipations. Mr.
Perkins, Uncle Israel, Mrs. Dodd, and Mrs.
Holmes each found a note under their plates
when they sat down. Uncle Israel&#8217;s face relaxed
into an expression of childlike joy when
he found the envelope addressed to him.
&#8220;Valentine, I reckon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or mebbe
it&#8217;s sunthin&#8217; from Santa Claus.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer acting for Santa Claus,&#8221; snorted
Mrs. Holmes, who had swiftly torn open her
note. &#8220;Here we are, all ordered away from
what&#8217;s been our home for years, by some
upstart relations who never saw poor, dear
uncle. Are you going to keep boarders?&#8221;
she asked, insolently, turning to Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No longer,&#8221; returned that young woman,
imperturbably. &#8220;I have done it just as long
as I intend to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan was gazing curiously at Dorothy,
but she avoided his eyes, and continued to
eat as though nothing had happened. Dick,
guessing rightly, choked, and had to be excused.
Elaine&#8217;s cheeks were flushed and her
eyes sparkled, the flush deepening when Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
Dodd inquired where <i>her</i> valentine was. Mr.
Perkins was openly dejected, and Mrs. Dodd,
receiving no answer to her question, compressed
her thin lips into a forced silence.</p>
<p>But Uncle Israel was moved to protesting
speech. &#8220;&#8217;T is queer doin&#8217;s for Santa Claus,&#8221;
he mumbled, pouring out a double dose of
his nerve tonic. &#8220;&#8217;T ain&#8217;t such a thing as
he&#8217;d do, even if he was drunk. Turnin&#8217; a
poor old man outdoor, what ain&#8217;t got no
place to go exceptin&#8217; to Betsey&#8217;s, an&#8217; nobody
can&#8217;t live with Betsey. She&#8217;s all the time
mad at herself on account of bein&#8217; obliged to
live with such a woman as she be. Summers
I&#8217;ve allers stayed here an&#8217; never made
no trouble. I&#8217;ve cooked my own food an&#8217;
brought most of it, an&#8217; provided all my own
medicines, an&#8217; even took my bed with me,
goin&#8217; an&#8217; comin&#8217;. Ebeneezer&#8217;s beds is all terrible
drafty&mdash;I took two colds to once sleepin&#8217;
in one of &#8217;em&mdash;an&#8217; at my time of life &#8217;t ain&#8217;t
proper to change beds. Sleepin&#8217; in a drafty
bed would undo all the good of bein&#8217; near
the sanitarium. Most likely I&#8217;ll have a fever
or sunthin&#8217; now an&#8217; die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, Israel,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, abruptly.
&#8220;You ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to die. It wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
surprise me none if you had to be shot on the
Day of Judgment before you could be resurrected.
Folks past ninety-five that&#8217;s pickled
in patent medicine from the inside out, ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to die of no fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ninety-six, Belinda,&#8221; said the old man,
proudly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be ninety-six next week, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m as young as I ever was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; rejoined Mrs. Dodd, tartly, &#8220;what
you want to look out for is measles an&#8217;
chicken-pox, to say nothin&#8217; of croup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Gladys Gwendolen and Algernon
Paul,&#8221; interrupted Mrs. Holmes, in a high
key; &#8220;we must go and pack now, to go
away from dear uncle&#8217;s. Dear uncle is dead,
you know, and can&#8217;t help his dear ones being
ordered out of his house by upstarts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a upstart, ma?&#8221; inquired Willie.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who turn their dead uncle&#8217;s relations
out of his house in order to take boarders,&#8221;
returned Mrs. Holmes, clearly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mis&#8217; Carr,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, sliding up
into Dick&#8217;s vacant place, &#8220;have I understood
that you want me to go away to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody is going away to-morrow,&#8221;
returned Dorothy, coldly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After all I&#8217;ve done for you?&#8221; persisted
Mrs. Dodd.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done for me?&#8221; parried
Dorothy, with a pleading look at Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kep&#8217; the others away,&#8221; returned Mrs.
Dodd, significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Ebeneezer does not want any of
you here,&#8221; said Dorothy, after a painful
silence. The impression made by the diary
was so vividly present with her that she
felt as though she were delivering an actual
message.</p>
<p>Much to her surprise, Mrs. Dodd paled and
left the room hastily. Uncle Israel tottered
after her, leaving his predigested food untouched
on his plate and his imitation coffee
steaming malodorously in his cup. Mr. Perkins
bowed his head upon his hands for a
moment; then, with a sigh, lightly dropped
out of the open window. The name of Uncle
Ebeneezer seemed to be one to conjure with.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;might an obedient
husband modestly inquire what you have
done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elaine and I found Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
diary to-day,&#8221; explained Dorothy, &#8220;and the
poor old soul was nagged all his life by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
relatives. So, in gratitude for what he&#8217;s
done for us, I&#8217;ve turned &#8217;em out. I know
he&#8217;d like to have me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan left his place and came to Dorothy,
where, bending over her chair, he kissed her
tenderly. &#8220;Good girl,&#8221; he said, patting her
shoulder. &#8220;Why in thunder didn&#8217;t you do
it months ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that just like a man?&#8221; asked Dorothy,
gazing after his retreating figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Elaine, with a
pretty blush, &#8220;but I guess it is.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>Various Departures</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Algernon Paul,&#8221; called Mrs. Holmes,
shrilly, &#8220;let the kitty alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Every one else on the premises heard the
command, but &#8220;Algernon Paul,&#8221; perhaps because
he was not yet fully accustomed to
his new name, continued forcing Claudius
Tiberius to walk about on his fore feet, the
rest of him being held uncomfortably in the
air by the guiding influence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Algernon!&#8221; The voice was so close
this time that the cat was freed by his persecutor&#8217;s
violent start. Seeing that it was only
his mother, Algernon Paul attempted to recover
his treasure again, and was badly
scratched by that selfsame treasure. Whereupon
Mrs. Holmes soundly cuffed Claudius
Tiberius &#8220;for scratching dear little Ebbie, I
mean Algernon Paul,&#8221; and received a bite or
two on her own account.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Ebbie, dear,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;we
are going now. We have been driven away
from dear uncle&#8217;s. Where is sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sister&#8221; was discovered in the forbidden
Paradise of the chicken-coop, and dragged
out, howling. Willie, not desiring to leave
&#8220;dear uncle&#8217;s,&#8221; was forcibly retrieved by Dick
from the roof of the barn.</p>
<p>Mr. Harold Vernon Perkins had silently
disappeared in the night, but no one feared
foul play. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be waitin&#8217; at the train, I
reckon,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd, &#8220;an&#8217; most likely
composin&#8217; a poem on &#8216;Departure&#8217; or else
breathin&#8217; into a tube to see if he&#8217;s mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had taken her dismissal very calmly
after the first shock. &#8220;A woman what&#8217;s
been married seven times, same as I be,&#8221; she
explained to Dorothy, &#8220;gets used to bein&#8217;
moved around from place to place. My sixth
husband had the movin&#8217; habit terrible. No
sooner would we get settled nice an&#8217; comfortable
in a place, an&#8217; I got enough acquainted to
borrow sugar an&#8217; tea an&#8217; molasses from my new
neighbours, than Thomas would decide to move,
an&#8217; more &#8217;n likely, it&#8217;d be to some new town
where there was a great openin&#8217; in some new
business that he&#8217;d never tried his hand at yet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I&#8217;ve been the wife of a undertaker,
a livery-stable keeper, a patent medicine
man, a grocer, a butcher, a farmer, an&#8217; a
justice of the peace, all in one an&#8217; the same
marriage. Seems &#8217;s if there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no business
Thomas couldn&#8217;t feel to turn his hand to, an&#8217;
he knowed how they all ought to be run. If
anybody was makin&#8217; a failure of anythin&#8217;,
Thomas knowed just why it was failin&#8217; an&#8217; I
must say he ought to know, too, for I never
see no more steady failer than Thomas.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say a rollin&#8217; stone never gets no
moss on it, but it gets worn terrible smooth,
an&#8217; by the time I &#8217;d moved to eight or ten different
towns an&#8217; got as many as &#8217;leven houses
all fixed up, the corners was all broke off &#8217;n
me as well as off &#8217;n the furniture. My third
husband left me well provided with furniture,
but when I went to my seventh altar, I didn&#8217;t
have nothin&#8217; left but a soap box an&#8217; half a
red blanket, on account of havin&#8217; moved
around so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got so&#8217;s I&#8217;d never unpack all the things
in any one place, but keep &#8217;em in their dry-goods
boxes an&#8217; barrels nice an&#8217; handy to go
on again. When the movin&#8217; fit come on
Thomas, I was always in such light marchin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
order that I could go on a day&#8217;s notice, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s the way we usually went. I told him
once it&#8217;d be easier an&#8217; cheaper to fit up a
prairie schooner such as they used to cross the
plains in, an&#8217; then when we wanted to move,
all we&#8217;d have to do would be to put a dipper of
water on the fire an&#8217; tell the mules to get ap,
but it riled him so terrible that I never said
nothin&#8217; about it again, though all through my
sixth marriage, it seemed a dretful likely
notion.</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman with much marryin&#8217; experience
soon learns not to rile a husband when &#8217;t ain&#8217;t
necessary. Sometimes I think the poor creeters
has enough to contend with outside without
bein&#8217; obliged to fight at home, though it
does beat all, my dear, what a terrible exertion
&#8217;t is for most men to earn a livin&#8217;. None
of my husbands was ever obliged to fight at
home an&#8217; I take great comfort thinkin&#8217; how
peaceful they all was when they was livin&#8217;
with me, an&#8217; how peaceful they all be now,
though I think it&#8217;s more &#8217;n likely that Thomas
is a-sufferin&#8217; because he can&#8217;t move no more
at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her monologue was interrupted by the arrival
of the stage, which Harlan had gladly ordered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Mrs. Holmes and the children climbed
into it without vouchsafing a word to anybody,
but Mrs. Dodd shook hands all around
and would have kissed both Dorothy and
Elaine had they not dodged the caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Dodd to
Dorothy; &#8220;I don&#8217;t bear you no grudge,
though I never was turned out of no place
before. It&#8217;s all in a lifetime, the same as
marryin&#8217;, and if I should ever marry again an&#8217;
have a home of my own to invite you to, you
an&#8217; your husband&#8217;ll be welcome to come and
stay with me as long as I&#8217;ve stayed with you,
or longer, if you felt &#8217;twas pleasant, an&#8217; I&#8217;d
try to make it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kindly speech made Dorothy very
much ashamed of herself, though she did not
know exactly why, and Gladys Gwendolen,
with a cherubic smile, leaned out of the stage
window and waved a chubby hand, saying:
&#8220;Bye bye!&#8221; Mrs. Holmes alone seemed
hard and unforgiving, as she sat sternly upright,
looking neither to the right nor the left.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather unusual, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; whispered
Elaine, as the ponderous vehicle turned into
the yard, &#8220;to see so many of one&#8217;s friends
going on the stage at once?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; chuckled Dick. &#8220;Everybody
goes on the stage when they leave the
Carrs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good bye, Belinda,&#8221; yelled Uncle Israel,
putting his flannel bandaged head out of one
of the round upper windows. He had climbed
up on a chair to do it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon I&#8217;ll
ever hear from you again exceptin&#8217; where
Lazarus heard from the rich man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that trouble you, Israel,&#8221;
shrieked Mrs. Dodd, piercingly. &#8220;I take it
the rich man was diggin&#8217; for eight cents in
Satan&#8217;s orchard, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t have no time to
look up his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rejoinder seemed not to affect Uncle
Israel, but it sent Dick into a spasm of merriment
from which he recovered only when
Harlan pounded him on the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;it&#8217;s not time to
laugh yet. We&#8217;ve got to pack Uncle Israel&#8217;s
bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Israel was going on the afternoon
train, and in another direction. He sat on his
trunk and issued minute instructions, occasionally
having the whole thing taken apart
to be put together in a different kind of a parcel.
As an especial favour, Dick was allowed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
to crate the bath cabinet, though as a rule, no
profane hands were permitted to touch this
instrument of health. Uncle Israel himself
arranged his bottles, and boxes, and powders;
a hand-satchel containing his medicines for
the journey and the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if I take a double
dose of my pain-killer, this noon, an&#8217; a double
dose of my nerve tonic just before I get on the
cars, I c&#8217;n get along with these few remedies
till I get to Betsey&#8217;s, where I&#8217;ll have to take a
full course of treatment to pay for all this
travellin&#8217;. The pain-killer bottle an&#8217; the nerve
tonic bottle is both dretful heavy, in spite of
bein&#8217; only half full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How would it do,&#8221; suggested Harlan,
kindly, &#8220;to pour the nerve tonic into the pain-killer,
and then you&#8217;d have only one bottle to
carry. You mix them inside, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem real intelligent, nephew,&#8221;
quavered Uncle Israel. &#8220;I never knowed I
had no such smart relations. As you say, I
mix &#8217;em in my system anyway, an&#8217; it can&#8217;t
do no harm to do it in the bottle first.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sooner said than done, but, strangely
enough, the mixture turned a vivid emerald
green, and had such a peculiarly vile odour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
that even Uncle Israel refused to have anything
further to do with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but what you&#8217;d done
me a real service, nephew,&#8221; continued Uncle
Israel. &#8220;Here I&#8217;ve been takin&#8217; this, month
after month, an&#8217; never suspectin&#8217; what it was
doin&#8217; in my insides. I&#8217;ve suspicioned for
some time that the pain-killer wan&#8217;t doin&#8217; me
no good, an&#8217; I&#8217;ve been goin&#8217; to try Doctor
Jones&#8217;s Squaw Remedy, anyhow. I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if my whole insides was green instead
of red as they orter be. The next time I go to
the City, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to take this here compound
to the healin&#8217; emporium where I bought it, an&#8217;
ask &#8217;em what there is in it that paints folk&#8217;s
insides. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; more &#8217;n green paint.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patient was so interested in this new
development that he demanded a paint-brush
and experimented on the porch railing, where
it seemed, indeed, to be &#8220;green paint.&#8221; In
getting a nearer view, he touched his nose to
it and acquired a bright green spot on the tip
of that highly useful organ. Desiring to test
it by every sense, he next put his ear down to
the railing, as though he expected to hear the
elements of the compound rushing together
explosively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My hearin&#8217; is bad,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I
wish you&#8217;d listen to this here a minute or
two, nephew, an&#8217; see if you don&#8217;t hear
sunthin&#8217;.&#8221; But Harlan, with his handkerchief
pressed tightly to his nose, politely declined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel,&#8221; continued Uncle Israel, tottering
into the house, &#8220;as though a poor,
sick man with green insides instead of red
orter be turned out. Judson Centre is a terrible
healthy place, or the sanitarium wouldn&#8217;t
have been built here, an&#8217; travellin&#8217; on the cars
would shake me up considerable. I feel as
though I was goin&#8217; to be took bad, an&#8217; as if I
ought not to go. If somebody&#8217;ll set up my bed,
I&#8217;ll just lay down on it an&#8217; die now. Ebeneezer
would be willin&#8217; for me to die in his house, I
know, for he&#8217;s often said it&#8217;d be a reel
pleasure to him to pay my funeral expenses
if I c&#8217;d only make up my mind to claim &#8217;em,
an&#8217;,&#8221; went on the old man pitifully, &#8220;I feel to
claim &#8217;em now. Set up my bed,&#8221; he wheezed,
&#8220;an&#8217; let me die. I&#8217;m bein&#8217; took bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was swiftly reasoning himself into abject
helplessness when Dick came valiantly to
the rescue. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what, Uncle Israel,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;if you&#8217;re going to be sick, and of
course you know whether you are or not,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
we&#8217;ll just get a carriage and take you over to
the sanitarium. I&#8217;ll pay your board there for
a week, myself, and by that time we&#8217;ll know
just what&#8217;s the matter with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The patient brightened amazingly at the
mention of the sanitarium, and was more
than willing to go. &#8220;I&#8217;ve took all kinds of
treatment,&#8221; he creaked, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t never
been to no sanitarium, an&#8217; I misdoubt whether
they&#8217;ve ever had anybody with green insides.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon,&#8221; he added, proudly, &#8220;that that
wanderin&#8217; pain in my spine&#8217;ll stump &#8217;em some
to know what it is. Even in the big store
where they keep all kinds of medicines, there
couldn&#8217;t nobody tell me. I know what disease
&#8217;tis, but I won&#8217;t tell nobody. A man knows
his own system best an&#8217; I reckon them smart
doctors up at the sanitarium &#8217;ll be scratchin&#8217;
their heads over such a complicated case as I
be. Send my bed on to Betsey&#8217;s but write
on it that it ain&#8217;t to be set up till I come.
&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be worth while settin&#8217; it up at
the sanitarium for a week, an&#8217; I&#8217;m minded to
try a medical bed, anyways. I ain&#8217;t never
had none. Get the carriage, quick, for I feel
an ailment comin&#8217; on me powerful hard every
minute.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Harlan, in a swift aside,
&#8220;that they refuse to take the patient? What
shall we do then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t discuss that,&#8221; answered Dick,
in a low tone. &#8220;My plan is to leave the patient,
drive away swiftly, and, an hour or so
later, walk back and settle with the head of
the repair shop for a week&#8217;s mending in
advance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan laughed gleefully, at which Uncle
Israel pricked up his ears. &#8220;I&#8217;m in on the
bill,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;we&#8217;ll go halves on the
mending.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laughin&#8217;&#8221; said Uncle Israel, scornfully,
&#8220;at your poor old uncle what ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
live much longer. If your insides was all
turned green, you wouldn&#8217;t be laughin&#8217;&mdash;you&#8217;d
be thinkin&#8217; about your immortal souls.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when the bed was
finally dumped on the side track to await the
arrival of the freight train, being securely covered
with a canvas tarpaulin to keep it from
the night dew and stray, malicious germs,
seeking that which they might devour. Uncle
Israel insisted upon overseeing this job himself,
so that he did not reach the sanitarium
until almost nightfall. Dick and Harlan were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
driving, and they shamelessly left the patient
at the door of the Temple of Healing, with his
crated bath cabinet, his few personal belongings,
and his medicines.</p>
<p>Turning back at the foot of the hill, they
saw that the wanderer had been taken in,
though the bath cabinet still remained outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mean trick to play on a respectable institution,&#8221;
observed Dick, lashing the horses into
a gallop, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll go over in the morning and
square it with &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; volunteered Harlan.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just as well to have two of us, for we
won&#8217;t be popular. The survivor can take
back the farewell message to the wife and
family of the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meant it for a jest, but even in the gathering
darkness, he could see the dull red mounting
to Dick&#8217;s temples. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be darned,&#8221;
thought Harlan, seeing the whole situation
instantly. Then, moved by a brotherly impulse,
he said, cheerfully: &#8220;Go in and win,
old man. Good luck to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; muttered Dick, huskily, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
no use. She won&#8217;t look at me. She wants
a nice lady-like poet, that&#8217;s what she wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Harlan, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
deep conviction. &#8220;I don&#8217;t claim to be a specialist,
but when a man and a poet are entered
for the matrimonial handicap, I&#8217;ll put my
money on the man, every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick swiftly changed the subject, and began
to speculate on probable happenings at the
sanitarium. They left the conveyance in the
village, from whence it had been taken, and
walked uphill.</p>
<p>Lights gleamed from every window of the
Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern, but the eccentric face of the
house had, for the first time, a friendly aspect.
Warmth and cheer were in the blinking eyes
and the grinning mouth, though, as Dick said,
it seemed impossible that &#8220;no pumpkin seeds
were left inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those who do not believe in personal influence
should go into a house which uninvited
and undesired guests have regretfully left.
Every alien element had gone from the house
on the hill, yet the very walls were still vocal
with discord. One expected, every moment,
to hear Uncle Israel&#8217;s wheeze, the shrill, spiteful
comment of Mrs. Holmes, or a howl from
one of the twins.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do,&#8221; asked Harlan, &#8220;to
celebrate the day of emancipation?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered Dorothy, with a little
laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;ll burn a bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose bed?&#8221; queried Dick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Perkins&#8217;s bed,&#8221; responded Elaine,
readily. The tone of her voice sent a warm
glow to Dick&#8217;s heart, and he went to work at
the heavy walnut structure with more gladness
than exercise of that particular kind had ever
given him before.</p>
<p>Harlan rummaged through the cellar and
found a bottle of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s old port,
which, for some occult reason, had hitherto
escaped. Mrs. Smithers, moved to joyful
song, did herself proud in the matter of fried
chicken and flaky biscuit. Dorothy had taken
all the leaves out of the table, so that now it
was cosily set for four, and placed a battered
old brass candlestick, with a tallow candle in
it, in the centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems like living, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked
Harlan. Until now, he had not known how
surely though secretly distressed he had been
by Aunt Rebecca&#8217;s persistent kin. Claudius
Tiberius apparently felt the prevailing cheerfulness,
and purred vigorously, in Elaine&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>Afterward, they made a fire in the parlour,
even though the night was so warm that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
were obliged to have all the windows open,
and, inspired by the portrait of Uncle Ebeneezer,
discussed the peculiarities of his self-invited
guests.</p>
<p>The sacrificial flame arising from the poet&#8217;s
bed directed the conversation to Mr. Perkins
and his gift of song. Dick, though feeling
more deeply upon the subject than any of the
rest, was wise enough not to say too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found something under his mattress,&#8221;
remarked Dick, when the conversation flagged,
&#8220;while I was taking his blooming crib apart
to chop it up. I guess it must be a poem.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a sorely flattened roll from his
pocket, and slipped off the crumpled blue
ribbon. It was, indeed, a poem, entitled
&#8220;Farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought he might have been polite
enough to say good bye,&#8221; said Dorothy.
&#8220;Perhaps it was easier to write it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read it,&#8221; cried Elaine, her eyes dancing.
&#8220;Please do!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Dick read as follows:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Poor Mr. Perkins,&#8221; commented Dorothy,
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; mimicked Harlan, &#8220;poor Mr. Perkins.
I don&#8217;t see but what he&#8217;ll have to work
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
now, like any plain, ordinary mortal, with no
&#8216;gift&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the Ideal, anyway?&#8221; queried
Elaine, looking thoughtfully into the embers
of the poet&#8217;s bedstead.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; answered Dick, not without
evident feeling. &#8220;It&#8217;s whatever Mr.
Perkins happens to be doing, or trying to do.
He fixes it for the rest of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; suggested Dorothy, after a momentary
silence, &#8220;that the Ideal consists in
minding your own business and gently, but
firmly, assisting others to mind theirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>All unknowingly, Dorothy had expressed
the dominant idea of the dead master of the
house. She fancied that the pictured face
over the mantel was about to smile at her.
Dorothy and Uncle Ebeneezer understood each
other now, and she no longer wished to have
the portrait moved.</p>
<p>Before they separated for the night, Dick
told them all about the midnight gathering in
the orchard, which he had witnessed from
afar, and which the others enjoyed beyond his
expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what uncle meant,&#8221; said Elaine,
&#8220;by &#8216;fixing a surprise for relations.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; observed Harlan,
&#8220;not a blooming bit. I wish the poor old
duck could have been here to see it. Why
wasn&#8217;t I in on it?&#8221; he demanded of Dick,
somewhat resentfully. &#8220;When anything like
that was going on, why didn&#8217;t you take me
in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t for me to interfere with his
doings,&#8221; protested Dick, &#8220;but I do wish you
could have seen Uncle Israel.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the recollection he went off into a spasm
of merriment which bid fair to prove fatal.
The rest laughed with him, not knowing just
what it was about, such was the infectious
quality of Dick&#8217;s mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve all gone,&#8221; laughed Elaine, happily,
taking her bedroom candle from Dorothy&#8217;s
hand, &#8220;they&#8217;ve all gone, every single
one, and now we&#8217;re going to have some good
times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick watched her as she went upstairs, the
candlelight shining tenderly upon her sweet
face, and thus betrayed himself to Dorothy,
who had suspected for some time that he
loved Elaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh Lord!&#8221; grumbled Dick to himself,
when he was safely in his own room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
&#8220;Everybody knows it now, except her. I&#8217;ll
bet even Sis Smithers and the cat are dead
next to me. I might as well tell her to-morrow
as any time, the result will be just the
same. Better do it and have it over with.
The cat&#8217;ll tell her if nobody else does.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that night, strangely enough, Claudius
Tiberius disappeared, to be seen or heard of
no more.</p>

<h2>XX</h2>
<h3>The Love of Another Elaine</h3>
</div>

<p>When Dick and Harlan ventured up to
the sanitarium, they were confronted
by the astonishing fact that Uncle Israel was,
indeed, ill. Later developements proved that
he was in a measure personally responsible
for his condition, since he had, surreptitiously,
in the night, mixed two or three medicines of
his own brewing with the liberal dose of a
different drug which the night nurse gave him,
in accordance with her instructions.</p>
<p>Far from being unconscious, however,
Uncle Israel was even now raging violently
against further restraint, and demanding to be
sent home before he was &#8220;murdered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s being killed with kindness,&#8221; whispered
Dick, &#8220;like the man who was run over
by an ambulance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan arranged for Uncle Israel to stay
until he was quite healed of this last complication,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
and then wrote out the address of
Cousin Betsey Skiles, with which Dick was
fortunately familiar. &#8220;And,&#8221; added Dick, &#8220;if
he&#8217;s troublesome, crate him and send him by
freight. We don&#8217;t want to see him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Less than a week later, Uncle Israel and his
bed were safely installed at Cousin Betsey&#8217;s,
and he was able to write twelve pages of
foolscap, fully expressing his opinion of Harlan
and Dick and the sanitarium staff, and
Uncle Ebeneezer, and the rest of the world in
general, conveying it by registered mail to
&#8220;J. H. Car &amp; Familey.&#8221; The composition
revealed an astonishing command of English,
particularly in the way of vituperation. Had
Uncle Israel known more profanity, he undoubtedly
would have incorporated it in the
text.</p>
<p>&#8220;It reminds me,&#8221; said Elaine, who was
permitted to read it, &#8220;of a little coloured boy
we used to know. A playmate quarrelled
with him and began to call him names, using
all the big words he had ever heard, regardless
of their meaning. When his vocabulary was
exhausted, our little friend asked, quietly: &#8216;Is
you froo?&#8217; &#8216;Yes,&#8217; returned the other, &#8216;I&#8217;s
froo.&#8217; &#8216;Well then,&#8217; said the master of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
situation, calmly, turning on his heel, &#8216;all
those things what you called me, you is.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; laughed Dick. &#8220;All those
things Uncle Israel has called us, he is, but it
makes him a pretty tough old customer.&#8221;</p>
<p>A blessed peace had descended upon the
house and its occupants. Harlan&#8217;s work was
swiftly nearing completion, and in another
day or two, he would be ready to read the
neatly typed pages to the members of his
household. Dorothy could scarcely wait to
hear it, and stole many a secret glance at the
manuscript when Harlan was out of the house.
Lover-like, she expected great things from it,
and she saw the world of readers, literally, at
her husband&#8217;s feet. So great was her faith in
him that she never for an instant suspected
that there might possibly be difficulty at the
start&mdash;that any publisher could be wary of
this masterpiece by an unknown.</p>
<p>The Carrs had planned to remain where
they were until the book was finished, then
to take the precious manuscript, and go forth
to conquer the City. Afterward, perhaps, a
second honeymoon journey, for both were
sorely in need of rest and recreation.</p>
<p>Elaine was going with them, and Dorothy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
was to interview the Personage whose private
secretary she had once been, and see if that
position or one fully as desirable could not be
found for her friend. Also, Elaine was to
make her home with the Carrs. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
let you live in a New York boarding house,&#8221;
said Dorothy warmly, &#8220;as long as we&#8217;ve any
kind of a roof over our heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dick had discovered that, as he expressed
it, he must &#8220;quit fooling and get a job.&#8221;
Hitherto, Mr. Chester had preferred care-free
idleness to any kind of toil, and a modest sum,
carefully hoarded, represented to Dick only
freedom to do as he pleased until it gave out.
Then he began to consider work again, but as
he seldom did the same kind of work twice, he
was not particularly proficient in any one line.</p>
<p>Still, Dick had no false ideas about labour.
At college he had canvassed for subscription
books, solicited life and fire insurance, swept
walks, shovelled snow, carried out ashes, and
even handled trunks for the express company,
all with the same cheerful equanimity. His
small but certain income sufficed for his tuition
and other necessary expenses, but for board at
Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s and a few small luxuries,
he was obliged to work.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>Just now, unwonted ambition fired his soul.
&#8220;It&#8217;s funny,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;what&#8217;s come over
me. I never hankered to work, even in my
wildest moments, and yet I pine for it this
minute&mdash;even street-sweeping would be welcome,
though that sort of thing isn&#8217;t going to
be much in my line from now on. With the
start uncle&#8217;s given me, I can surely get along
all right, and, anyhow, I&#8217;ve got two hands,
two feet, and one head, all good of their kind,
so there&#8217;s no call to worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worrying had never been among Dick&#8217;s
accomplishments, but he was restless, and
eager for something to do. He plunged into
furniture-making with renewed energy, inspired
by the presence of Elaine, who with
her book or embroidery sat in her low rocker
under the apple tree and watched him at his
work.</p>
<p>Quite often she read aloud, sometimes a
paragraph, now and then an entire chapter, to
which Dick submitted pleasantly. He loved
the smooth, soft cadence of Elaine&#8217;s low voice,
whether she read or spoke, so, in a way, it
did not matter. But, one day, when she had
read uninterruptedly for over an hour, Dick
was seized with a violent fit of coughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; he began, when the paroxysm had
ceased; &#8220;you like books, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I do&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;yes, of course, but say&mdash;aren&#8217;t you
tired of reading?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. You needn&#8217;t worry about me.
When I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;ll stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pleased with his kindly thought
for her comfort, and thereafter read a great
deal by way of reward. As for Dick, he
burned the midnight candle over many a book
which he found inexpressibly dull, and skilfully
led the conversation to it the next day.
Soon, even Harlan was impressed by his wide
knowledge of literature, though no one noted
that about books not in Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s
library, Dick knew nothing at all.</p>
<p>Dorothy spent much of her time in her own
room, thus forcing Dick and Elaine to depend
upon each other for society. Quite often she
was lonely, and longed for their cheery chatter,
but sternly reminded herself that she was
being sacrificed in a good cause. She built
many an air castle for them as well as for herself,
furnishing both, impartially, with Elaine&#8217;s
old mahogany and the simple furniture Dick
was making out of Uncle Ebeneezer&#8217;s relics.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>By this time the Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern was nearly
stripped of everything which might prove
useful, and they were burning the rest of it in
the fireplace at night. &#8220;Varnished hardwood,&#8221;
as Dick said, &#8220;makes a peach of a
blaze.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Harlan was labouring steadfastly
at his manuscript. The glowing fancy from
which the book had sprung was quite gone.
Still, as he cut, rearranged, changed, interlined,
reconstructed and polished, he was not
wholly unsatisfied with his work. &#8220;It may
not be very good,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s the best I can do&mdash;now. The next will
be better, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221; He knew, even then,
that there would be a &#8220;next one,&#8221; for the
eternal thirst which knows no quenching had
seized upon his inmost soul.</p>
<p>Hereafter, by an inexplicably swift reversion,
he should see all life as literature, and literature
as life. Friends and acquaintances should
all be, in his inmost consciousness, ephemeral.
And Dorothy&mdash;dearly as he loved her, was
separated from him as by a veil.</p>
<p>Still, as he worked, he came gradually to a
better adjustment, and was very tenderly anxious
that Dorothy should see no change in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
him. He had not yet reached the point, however,
where he would give it all up for the sake
of finding things real again, if only for an hour.</p>
<p>Day after day, his work went on. Sometimes
he would spend an hour searching for a
single word, rightly to express his meaning.
Page after page was re-copied upon the typewriter,
for, with the nice conscience of a good
workman, Harlan desired a perfect manuscript,
at least in mechanical details.</p>
<p>Finally, he came to the last page and printed
&#8220;The End&#8221; in capitals with deep satisfaction.
&#8220;When it&#8217;s sandpapered,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;and the dust blown off, I suppose it
will be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;sandpapering&#8221; took a week longer.
At the end of that time, Harlan concluded that
any manuscript was done when the writer
had read it carefully a dozen times without
making a single change in it. On a Saturday
night, just as the hall clock was booming
eleven, he pushed it aside, and sat staring
blankly at the wall for a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve got,&#8221; he thought,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve certainly got two hundred and fifty
pages of typed manuscript. It should be good
for something&mdash;even at space rates.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>After dinner, Sunday, he told them that the
book was ready, and they all went out into
the orchard. Dick was resigned, Elaine pleasantly
excited, Dorothy eager and aflame with
triumphant pride, Harlan self-conscious, and,
in a way, ashamed.</p>
<p>As he read, however, he forgot everything
else. The mere sound of the words came
with caressing music to his ears. At times
his voice wavered and his hands trembled,
but he kept on, until it grew so dark that he
could no longer see.</p>
<p>They went into the house silently, and Dick
touched a match to the fire already laid in the
fireplace, while Dorothy lighted the candles
and the reading lamp. The afterglow faded
and the moon rose, yet still they rode with
Elaine and her company, through mountain
passes and over blossoming fields, past many
dangers and strange happenings, and ever
away from the Castle of Content.</p>
<p>Harlan&#8217;s deep, vibrant voice, now stern,
now tender, gave new meaning to his work.
His secret belief in it gave it a beauty which
no one else would ever see. Dorothy, listening
so intently that it was almost pain, never
took her eyes from his face. In that hour, if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
Harlan could have known it, her woman&#8217;s
soul was kneeling before his, naked and
unashamed.</p>
<p>Dick privately considered the whole thing
more or less of a nuisance, but the candlelight
touched Elaine&#8217;s golden hair lovingly,
and the glow from the fire seemed to rest
caressingly upon her face. All along, he saw
a clear resemblance between his Elaine and
the lady of the book, also, more keenly, a
closer likeness between himself and the fool
who rode at her side.</p>
<p>When Harlan came to the song which the
fool had written, and which he had so shamelessly
revised and read aloud at the table, Dick
seriously considered a private and permanent
departure, like the nocturnal vanishing of Mr.
Perkins, without even a poem for farewell.</p>
<p>Elaine, lost in the story, was heedless of her
surroundings. It was only at the last chapter
that she became conscious of self at all. Then,
suddenly, in her turn, she perceived a parallel,
and quivered painfully with a new emotion.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Some one, perchance,&#8221; mused the Lady
Elaine, &#8220;whose beauty my eyes alone should
perceive, whose valour only I should guess
before there was need to test it. Some one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
great of heart and clean of mind, in whose
eyes there should never be that which makes a
woman ashamed. Some one fine-fibred and
strong-souled, not above tenderness when a
maid was tired. One who should make a
shield of his love, to keep her not only from
the great hurts but from the little ones as well,
and yet with whom she might fare onward,
shoulder to shoulder, as God meant mates
should fare.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Like the other Elaine, she saw who had
served her secretly, asking for no recognition;
who had always kept watch over her so unobtrusively
and quietly that she never guessed
it till now. Like many another woman,
Elaine had dreamed of her Prince as a paragon
of beauty and perfection, with unconscious
vanity deeming such an one her true
mate. Now her story-book lover had gone
for ever, and in his place was Dick; sunny-hearted,
mischievous, whistling, clear-eyed
Dick, who had laughed and joked with her
all Summer, and now&mdash;must never know.</p>
<p>In a fierce agony of shame, she wondered
if he had already guessed her secret&mdash;if she
had betrayed it to him before she was conscious
of it herself; if that was why he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
been so kind. Harlan was reading the last
page, and Elaine shaded her face with her
hand, determined, at all costs, to avoid Dick,
and to go away to-morrow, somewhere,
anywhere.</p>
<p><i>But Prince Bernard did not hear</i>, read
Harlan, <i>nor see the outstretched hand, for
Elaine was in his arms for the first time,
her sweet lips close on his. &#8220;My Prince, Oh,
my Prince,&#8221; she murmured, when at length
he set her free; &#8220;my eyes did not see but my
heart knew!&#8221;</i></p>
<p><i>So ended the Quest of the Lady Elaine.</i></p>
<p>The last page of the manuscript fluttered,
face downward, upon the table, and Dorothy
wiped her eyes. Elaine&#8217;s mouth was parched,
but she staggered to her feet, knowing that
she must say some conventional words of
congratulation to Harlan, then go to her own
room.</p>
<p>Blindly, she put out her hand, trying to
speak; then, for a single illuminating instant,
her eyes looked into Dick&#8217;s.</p>
<p>With a little cry, Elaine fled from the room,
overwhelmed with shame. In a twinkling,
she was out of the house, and flying toward
the orchard as fast as her light feet would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
carry her, her heart beating wildly in her
breast.</p>
<p>By the sure instinct of a lover, Dick knew
that his hour had come. He dropped out of the
window and overtook her just as she reached
her little rocking-chair, which, damp with the
Autumn dew, was still under the apple tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elaine!&#8221; cried Dick, crushing her into his
arms, all the joy of youth and love in his
voice. &#8220;Elaine! My Elaine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The audience,&#8221; remarked Harlan, in an
unnatural tone, &#8220;appears to have gone. Only
my faithful wife stands by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Harlan,&#8221; answered Dorothy, with a
swift rush of feeling, &#8220;you&#8217;ll never know till
your dying day how proud and happy I am.
It&#8217;s the very beautifullest book that anybody
ever wrote, and I&#8217;m so glad! Mrs. Shakespeare
could never have been half as pleased
as I am! I&mdash;&mdash;,&#8221; but the rest was lost, for
Dorothy was in his arms, crying her heart
out for sheer joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; said Harlan, patting her
shoulders awkwardly, and rubbing his rough
cheek against her tear-wet face; &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t
meant to make anybody cry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t I cry if I want to?&#8221; demanded
Dorothy, resentfully, between sobs. Harlan&#8217;s
voice was far from even and his own eyes
were misty as he answered: &#8220;Because you
are my own darling girl and I love you, that&#8217;s
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat hand in hand for a long time,
looking into the embers of the dying fire, in
the depths of that wedded silence which
has no need of words. The portraits of Uncle
Ebeneezer and Aunt Rebecca seemed fully in
accord, and, though mute, eloquent with
understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be so proud,&#8221; whispered Dorothy,
looking up at the stern face over the mantel,
&#8220;if he knew what you had done here in his
house. He loved books, and now, because of
his kindness, you can always write them.
You&#8217;ll never have to go back on the paper
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harlan smiled reminiscently, for the hurrying,
ceaseless grind of the newspaper office
was, indeed, a thing of the past. The dim,
quiet room was his, not the battle-ground of
the street. Still, as he knew, the smell of
printer&#8217;s ink in his nostrils would be like the
sound of a bugle to an old cavalry horse, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
even now, he would not quite trust himself to
walk down Newspaper Row.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Uncle Ebeneezer and Aunt Rebecca,&#8221;
went on Dorothy, happily. &#8220;I love
everybody. I&#8217;ve love enough to-night to
spare some for the whole world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear little saint,&#8221; said Harlan, softly, &#8220;I
believe you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clock struck ten and the fire died down.
A candle flickered in its socket, then went
out. The chill Autumn mist was rising, and
through it the new moon gleamed faintly, like
veiled pearl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Harlan, &#8220;where the rest
of the audience is? If everybody who reads
the book is going to disappear suddenly and
mysteriously, I won&#8217;t be the popular author
that I pine to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; responded Dorothy; &#8220;I think
they are coming now. I&#8217;ll go and let them
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only a single candle was burning in the
hall, and when Dorothy opened the door, it
went out suddenly, but in that brief instant,
she had seen their glorified faces and understood
it all. The library door was open, and
the dimly lighted room seemed like a haven of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
refuge to Elaine, radiantly self-conscious, and
blushing with sweet shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said Dick, awkwardly, with a tremendous
effort to appear natural, &#8220;we&#8217;ve
just been out to get a breath of fresh air.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had taken them two hours, but Dorothy
was too wise to say anything. She only
laughed&mdash;a happy, tender, musical little laugh.
Then she impulsively kissed them both,
pushed Elaine gently into the library, and
went back into the parlour to tell Harlan.</p>
